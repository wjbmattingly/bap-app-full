TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
AMNESTY HEARINGDATE: 09-07-1997 
  NAME: BASSIE MKHUMBUZI THOBELA MLAMBISA GCINIKHAYA MAKOMA  
DAY 1_________________________________________________________________
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink, are we ready to commence? MR BRINK: Mr Chairman, 
  there seems to be some confusion. On your papers, the front cover, the index, 
  there is reference to the first applicant as Makoma, the second one Mkhumbuzi 
  who is here. Those two are here. The third one who is here is a gentleman known 
  as Thobela Mlambisa. Mr Letlapa Mphlalele who had brought an application, is 
  I understand not attending. He will not be attending. That is Letlapa Mphlalele, 
  he made an application, he was notified but I gather he will not be appearing. 
  I can't hear you sir. CHAIRMAN: Has he communicated that? MR BRINK: 
  I am advised by those who represent the PAC in this matter. CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes. So now, is there somebody else in the application by Mr Mphlalele? MR 
  BRINK: Yes, and that is this gentleman Mr Thobela Mlambisa.JUDGE WILSON: 
  And we doesn't have an application for him? MR BRINK: I will arrange 
  to get it out, I don't know how this happened, how these things have gone like 
  this. I understand however, there was application lodged and it is very much 
  in the same terms as the application form, form 1's which you have in respect 
  of Mkhumbuzi and Makoma and I understand further that affidavits had been prepared 
  by those representing these three on the same form as in the Amy Biehl matter. 
  CHAIRMAN: May we have the name of the third applicant Mr Arendse, please. 
  MR BRINK: The third applicant today is Thobela Mlambisa. CHAIRMAN: 
  Thank you. Yes, Mr Arendse. ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman, learned 
  members of the Committee. Myself and my colleague, Ms Goza appear here for these 
  applicants in this matter. Mr Chairman, it is correct that Mr Mphlalele, has 
  not given us any instructions. We actually don't know where he is at the moment, 
  so we are not here to represent him and he is not before the Committee. In any 
  case it will become apparent soon, that he was not actively involved in the 
  St James incident, it would appear from his application for amnesty relating 
  to the St James incident, that at the time, he is the time who gave the orders, 
  the instructions, he was the Director of Operations of APLA, so he is not here 
  before you today unfortunately. CHAIRMAN: Yes. ADV ARENDSE: Mr 
  Mlambisa is in fact an accused in the trial pending against him and Bassie Mkhumbuzi 
  in the St James matter and we were always under the impression that his application 
  is before you, so just last week, during the course of last week, we submitted 
  an affidavit on behalf of Mr Mlambisa stating that he did in fact apply. Since 
  then, we have been told that his application had been found and that the matter 
  is enroled to be heard today together with the other two. I am not sure what 
  arrangements internally, why Mr Brink was not advised of this. CHAIRMAN: 
  Mr Brink you will sort that out in due course? MR BRINK: I will most 
  certainly do so. CHAIRMAN: Yes. Mr Bembridge?  ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Honourable Committee, we appear, myself and Mr O'Dowd, who is from the firm 
  Hofmeyr Herbsteins, today I appear on his instruction to represent the victims 
  in this matter, Mr Dawie Ackerman and Mr Lorenzo Smith. I understand that there 
  are a number of victims of the massacre present at the hearing today, although 
  they have not all specifically and formally opposed the matter, they are in 
  fact present at the hearing today. We however only represent Mr Smith and Mr 
  Ackerman at this stage. CHAIRMAN: Yes, good, thank you. We will record 
  that. MR BRINK: Mr Chairman, may I also ask you to make a note I did 
  receive by way of correspondence a formal objection to the applications for 
  amnesty by Mr Dimitri Makogon. This gentleman is away from Cape Town at this 
  time, but indicated that he strongly oppose the application. He was in the church 
  when this incident happened and he lost two legs and one arm. He was a Russian 
  citizen. Whether he is still ... CHAIRMAN: What is the date of that letter? 
  MR BRINK: That came, and I haven't got the letter with me immediately, 
  but it came about three weeks ago. It was fairly recent. CHAIRMAN: Yes. 
  MR BRINK: As far as all the next of kin and victims are concerned, notification 
  was given to all those who had an available address. I may say that Bishop Frank 
  Retief, the Bishop of the Church of England South Africa, and who is apparently 
  connected to St James Church, was very helpful and cooperative and he sent me 
  a list of all those whose whereabouts he was aware of and notices accordingly, 
  were given to those people. In addition notice of these proceedings were published 
  in the church magazine, so that, and I believe announced in church itself, so 
  that all those who were involved, apart from those who have left Cape Town and 
  left the country, are aware of the matter. CHAIRMAN: Mr Arendse? ADV 
  ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman. Just for the record, the applicants are 
  sitting from left to right in the order in which we intend to, or we propose 
  to deal with the applications. Bassie Mkhumbuzi and in the middle Thobela Mlambisa 
  and on his left Gcinikhaya Makoma. Mr Chairman, as far as objections to the 
  amnesty applications are concerned, my colleague and I, we only know about that 
  through the press. We haven't been given or we don't know, we can only assume 
  on what basis the applications are being opposed. Now, I suppose that Mr Ackerman 
  and Mr Smith will be giving evidence before this Committee. We haven't had the 
  benefit of seeing any statements which they have perhaps submitted or handed 
  in to the Committee or to the TRC, so we haven't had the benefit of discussing 
  them with the applicants. CHAIRMAN: Yes, in the past the practise has 
  just been that notification, rather notice of these applications are sent to 
  interested parties and they turn up on the morning of the trial to say they 
  are opposing the application and that is the notification we received. In terms 
  of the Act, they are not required to furnish the grounds for opposition. In 
  other words, the Act doesn't say that they mustn't furnish, but there is no 
  provision in the Act requiring them to furnish their grounds for opposition. 
  So we just have to do the best we can as we go along. ADV ARENDSE: I 
  agree, I just mentioned that just in case we need to ask for an adjournment 
  or whatever to take instructions. CHAIRMAN: Yes. ADV ARENDSE: 
  Then also just for the record, Mr Chairman, Mr Mlambisa's application number 
  is AM7596/97. CHAIRMAN: Thank you. MR BRINK: When was it submitted? 
  Do you know when it was submitted, what date it was received by the Committee? 
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink, did I understand earlier that you may be handing 
  in documents at some stage? If your documents are ready it might be convenient 
  if you made them available as soon as you can. MR BRINK: Judge, I believe 
  we are at the present in the process of preparing some extra copies. Perhaps 
  in also in response to my learned friend's comments, we were as I previously 
  advised, briefed in this matter on very short notice, we have only had some 
  two days to prepare for the matter and that is the reason for no proper previous 
  discussion between us as to the opposition of the matter and we, as I also mentioned, 
  may also require some indulgence from the Committee in that regard. As I understand 
  there are copies of the documents which people propose to use, being prepared 
  at the moment. We do however, have a number of copies presently available. I 
  am not just quite sure as to on what basis we should at this stage distribute 
  them among the various interested persons until the required number have in 
  fact been prepared. CHAIRMAN: Did Mr Arendse and Ms Goza have adequate 
  notice of what is contained in your papers? The sooner they know about it, the 
  better it would be for us? MR BRINK: Certainly we are in a position to 
  provide them with copies right away and we have also a certain number of copies 
  which we could provide to the Committee right now. CHAIRMAN: You may 
  do so as soon as you can. ADV ARENDSE ADDRESSES: Mr Chairman and learned 
  members of the Committee, then just by way of an opening statement, can we just 
  put the following on record. Unfortunately developments before this Committee 
  have caught up with us and we haven't managed to put this together in writing 
  this time, so I am afraid I am just going to have to read this back to you. 
  Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, on the 3rd of March 1995 Gcinikhaya 
  Makoma was found guilty of eleven counts of murder of the attempted murder of 
  at least 58 people and of the unlawful possession of arms and ammunition. This 
  incident took place at the St James Church in Kenilworth on Sunday, the 25th 
  of July 1993. It is notoriously known as the St James Church massacre. Makoma 
  was sentenced to 23 years imprisonment and he is currently doing his sentence. 
  In the judgement the court, the trial court found that "it was plainly 
  a joint enterprise". Makoma was the only accused in the trial. That is 
  at page 69 of the record. The applicants Mkhumbuzi and Mlambisa were part of 
  that joint enterprise. They currently face the same charges relating to the 
  St James incident and they are out on bail at the moment. We will be submitting 
  Mr Chairman, that the applicants Makoma, Mlambisa and Mkhumbuzi be granted amnesty 
  for the following reasons: Firstly, at the time they were all members of APLA. 
  Secondly they carried out the orders of APLA Commanders, more particularly Sichumiso 
  Nonxuba. Nonxuba is now deceased. He died in a motor car accident in November 
  last year, while he was out on bail in connection with this matter and he was 
  accused 1 in the subsequent matter, not the one that Makoma was in. He was the 
  Commander of the operation and he was one of the persons who was in church, 
  who came into the church, threw a handgrenade and fired the shots which caused 
  the deaths of 11 people and injured many others. Mr Chairman, members of the 
  Committee, if it is of any value, myself and Ms Goza also represent the accused 
  in the second St James trial, if you can put it that way, and we know this as 
  fact. Those instructions were given to us. Just in case, we are not saying this 
  because the man is now deceased and we can take the liberty of using his name. 
  The other person I was saying Mr Chairman, who gave an order was Letlapa Mphlalele, 
  and that will also appear from his application form which one finds at pages 
  15 to 21 of the bundle. He was the Director of Operations of APLA at the time. 
  The third reason which we advance for submitting that they should be granted 
  amnesty, is that APLA is the armed wing of the PAC, was a political liberation 
  movement as defined in the Act and at the time APLA was waging a struggle against 
  the State, private property and private individuals in pursuance of their objectives. 
  We will also submit Mr Chairman, that the acts were associated with a political 
  objective, that of APLA, namely to free the country for the Africans so that 
  they can get their land back. The applicants acted or orders, on instructions. 
  The acts took place in a political context when this country was being ruled 
  by a White minority, regarded as illegitimate by the Black majority. The St 
  James churchgoers were regarded as part of that White minority. Now Mr Chairman 
  and members of the Committee, we must just pause there because it is clear that 
  a number of so-called Coloured people and I think Mr Smith, whom I happen to 
  know personally, was also in church at the time. And we will submit that the 
  applicants assumed that because St James was in a White group area, as it was 
  defined then, that all the churchgoers were White. They were obviously wrong 
  in assuming that. We will also submit that the acts were performed in the execution 
  of an APLA High Command order, that having regard to the political context at 
  the time, that the offences were directly proportionate to the political objectives 
  sought to be achieved by APLA and lastly Mr Chairman, that the offences were 
  not committed for personal gain and were not done out of personal malice, ill-will 
  or spite against any of the deceased or the victims concerned. Thank you Mr 
  Chairman. ADV DE JAGER: Mr Arendse, as far as Mr Mphlalele is concerned, 
  were you originally instructed to appear on his behalf, what is his position? 
  Was he given notice through your Attorneys or Mr Brink perhaps could assist 
  us there? Is he in default today or how should we treat his application? ADV 
  ARENDSE: Mr De Jager, Mr Chairman, Mr Mphlalele has always given us instructions. 
  Mr Mphlalele, it is well-known for what it is worth, to the staff here at the 
  TRC, that he actively, he in fact brought in boxes full of applications for 
  amnesty being made on behalf of APLA members. He had been involved with us as 
  legal counsel in this matter since last year already. We were in fact present 
  during the course of last year, when the applications were made the first time. 
  I think they were only confirmed though, in May this year. That appears from 
  the application. So, we can't understand and we don't have any reason why he 
  is not here. And we just hope that for his sake, that nothing happened to him. 
  He has got every reason to be here. So we want to ask that as far as his application 
  is concerned, that that be withdrawn at this stage and be re-enroled at a subsequent 
  stage. CHAIRMAN: Very well, we will do that. ADV ARENDSE: Thank 
  you Mr Chairman. Mr Brink, you will make note of that. JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  Sorry, let me just interrupt you on that. I notice that in your opening address, 
  you made reference to Mr Mphlalele's application. I don't know what you had 
  in mind in that regard. Are we going to be at large to use the contents of his 
  application, for example in cross-examining the applicants? ADV ARENDSE: 
  I would submit yes, that regard can be had. I think these applications are made 
  before a Commission of votes, so it is in the form of an affidavit and certainly, 
  we want to rely on what he says in his application. JUDGE NGOEPE: You 
  might have to give it a more careful thought, because it could have the kind 
  of consequences that may cause problems to the applicants, may prejudice the 
  applicants. And I think you should as the Chairman has asked, you said you are 
  withdrawing his application, you want it to be removed from the role as it were. 
  You are not withdrawing his application, because if you withdraw his application, 
  you may not make it later, you will be out of time to make another application. 
  You are just asking us to remove it from the roll? ADV ARENDSE: That 
  is correct, Judge Ngoepe. JUDGE NGOEPE: Yes, well the only point that 
  remains is what I have asked you, whether you are saying that we should use 
  his affidavit to cross-examine your clients for example. Maybe you should give 
  it some careful thought. ADV ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, it is part of the 
  record. The contents of his application have been discussed with the applicants 
  and we certainly note Judge Ngoepe's concerns and we will cross that bridge 
  when we come to it. MR BRINK: The problem I have Mr Chairman in that 
  regard, although it would have been difficult, but I understood from Mr Arendse 
  neither he nor Ms Goza were actually representing Mr Mphlalele. If they had 
  not instructions from him, I don't see how they can ask for the matter to be 
  removed from the role and maybe set down for another day, that is the problem 
  I have. Without direct instructions, but I am not making difficulties, it is 
  just ... CHAIRMAN: All we can say at this stage, Mr Mphlalele's application 
  stands down until we hear further. ADV ARENDSE: Very well. MR BRINK: 
  Mr Chairman, may I just mention one aspect on that point. It seems to me that 
  the application on behalf of the applicants who are presently before the Committee, 
  is somewhat premised on what will be said by Mr Mphlalele and that they presume 
  to state that he was the person who gave them orders, it appears to me that 
  they intend to rely for support in their applications, on what will be said 
  by that person. To the extent that these proceedings are also premised on a 
  full disclosure, I have some difficulty as to how the Committee is expected 
  or will be able rather, to make findings as to whether full disclosure has been 
  made, whether a truthful disclosure has been made, whether there is any foundation 
  in what is being said by the other applicants, without being able to test what 
  the person who they rely on, would in fact say. CHAIRMAN: We will wrestle 
  as we get along. How we would propose to deal with the evidence that is going 
  to be adduced before us, the Committee will decide. But we can't postpone these 
  proceedings just because Mr Mphlalele is not here and we are going to proceed 
  and cross-examination invariably can be directed at applicants at any kind of 
  information that may be at your disposal, it need not be evidence in anybody 
  else's document or affidavit. So, to what extent reliance is placed on their 
  evidence and they acted on the orders of so and so, when so and so is not here 
  to confirm it, these are matters which we will have to decide when the time 
  comes. MR BRINK: I understand. CHAIRMAN: For the time being, we 
  will just proceed with the evidence. MR BRINK: I understand that. ADV 
  DE JAGER: Perhaps Mr Arendse, could I add, you should perhaps have a look 
  at Section 19(8) whether this application of Mr Mphlalele is a public document 
  now and whether it can be used. Was the hearing in connection with himself, 
  I don't know whether we've started that? ADV ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, I 
  did say earlier that we always had instructions from Mr Mphlalele to represent 
  him. When I say we don't have instructions, we don't have instructions today 
  to make representations on his behalf for example. So we certainly don't have 
  any objections to reference being made to his application and that the contents 
  of the application being disclosed publicly. JUDGE WILSON: Did he instruct 
  you to appear at these hearings? ADV ARENDSE: Yes, Judge. JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  ... properly understood, Mr Bembridge's argument is that you want to take an 
  affidavit of Mr Mphlalele, you want to base your case on it and yet, he is not 
  here for him to cross-examine him in that regard? I think actually that is what 
  he is saying. In other words, you understand what I mean, he is saying that 
  Mr Mphlalele is not here, you ask us to stand down his application, but at the 
  same time, you want to retain his affidavit, which is very fundamental apparently 
  to your clients' case. You want to rely on it, but he is not going to be able 
  to cross-examine Mr Mphlalele because he is not here. ADV ARENDSE: The 
  evidence will reveal that the reliance is more apparent than real. There is 
  no reliance on Mr Mphlalele's application. And I would go along with the suggestion 
  of the Chairman that we proceed and that we deal with that aspect if and when 
  it becomes necessary. CHAIRMAN: Yes, Mr Arendse, you may proceed. ADV 
  ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, then just along the same lines and the previous application, 
  we want to hand up affidavits. Copies have been made available to my colleagues. 
  The original if we could mark that Exhibit A.
  CHAIRMAN: This is the affidavit of whom? ADV ARENDSE: Sorry Mr Chairman, 
  we intend to start in that order I said, Mkhumbuzi, Mlambisa and Makoma. CHAIRMAN: 
  The affidavit of Mr Mkhumbuzi will go in as Exhibit A.
ADV ARENDSE: Thank you. Mr Chairman, thank you. The affidavit of Bassie 
  Nzikizi Mkhumbuzi. Copies have also been made available to the interpreters, 
  Mr Chairman. "I, the undersigned, Bassie Nzikizi Mkhumbuzi, do hereby make 
  oath and say that I am aged 21 years and I reside at 2023 Unathi, Old Crossroads. 
  I am unmarried and I am the father of three children aged four, one and eleven 
  months. The facts to which I depose, are true and correct and within my personal 
  knowledge, unless the context otherwise indicates. I grew up in Cape Town and 
  went to school in Cape Town and reached standard 8, at Vuyiseka High School 
  in Woodstock. I am currently facing eleven charges of murder, charges of attempted 
  murder and three of unlawful possession of arms and ammunition. I am out on 
  bail at the moment and I am currently stationed at 3 SYI Infantry Battalion 
  in Kimberley doing my basic military training. I will shortly be transferred 
  to the Northern Cape Command on a permanent basis. The charges which I face, 
  relate to the events at the St James Church in 3rd Avenue, Kenilworth in the 
  District of Wynberg, on Sunday, the 25th of July, 1993. At the time, I was 17 
  years old. I have submitted an application for amnesty in terms of Section 18 
  of the Act in respect of the charges which I face. I have been a member of the 
  Pan African Congress since 1989 and a member of the African People's Liberation 
  Army since November 1992. Before that, as an organiser of the PAC Youth League, 
  AZANYO, I had actively supported members of APLA by providing assistance when 
  called upon to do so. I was a member of an APLA Unit of which Makoma was a trainer, 
  that is one of the other applicants. We held regular weekly meetings where we 
  allocated each other various tasks. We would always report back at the weekly 
  meetings whether or not the tasks we were given at the previous meeting, was 
  carried out. As a member of APLA I was trained by APLA Operators and Commanders 
  in various aspects of conducting guerilla warfare. The training I received included 
  physical training, attending political classes and receiving instructions on 
  how to use and operate weapons, ammunition, arms and handgrenades. I was also 
  taught how to make petrol bombs referred to as Molatov Cocktails. Approximately 
  a week before the St James incident took place, Makoma told me that an operation 
  was going to take place and that we were to prepare ourselves. He did not tell 
  me when or where or what operation would take place or what the target or targets 
  would be. He instructed me to prepare myself by getting into top physical condition 
  and more importantly, I was instructed to get weapons and ammunition in Umtata, 
  Transkei from comrades at the APLA High Command. I cannot recall the names of 
  these persons, I was given their code names and I cannot remember them any longer. 
  I went to the Transkei on the Monday before the incident and returned on the 
  Thursday. I went alone on a bus, I went to the address I was instructed to go 
  to and there met some APLA comrades and they gave me two R4 rifles, 365 rounds 
  of R4 ammunition, 3 M26 handgrenades plus the sum of R200-00 rand. At this point 
  I was not told why I had to collect the arms and ammunition, or for what purpose 
  it would be used. I knew, however, from my training, that it would be used for 
  some or other operation. On my return to Cape Town, on the Thursday, I took 
  the bag containing these arms and ammunition to a house in Khayelitsha. After 
  I left the arms and ammunition at the house, I was instructed to inform Sichomiso 
  Nonxuba, now deceased where the house was where I stored the arms and ammunition. 
  I did as I was told and took Nonxuba to the house, left him there and I don't 
  know what happened to the arms and ammunition after that. I did however, see 
  the same bag on the Sunday when the operation took place and while we were at 
  the Langa taxi rank. I assumed that the same military hardware was in the bag. 
  On that Thursday when I left Nonxuba at the house in Khayelitsha he told me 
  that we would meet again on the Saturday, the 24th of July, 1993 at approximately 
  three o'clock at the Iona shopping centre in Guguletu. When I arrived there 
  the Saturday afternoon I saw Nonxuba and Mlambisa there for the first time. 
  Nonxuba introduced Mlambisa to me as Aubrey and he told me that Aubrey was going 
  to work with us. Nonxuba instructed me to prepare four petrol bombs on the Saturday 
  and that I had to have it ready for the operation on the Sunday. At this point, 
  all that Nonxuba told me and Aubrey, that there would be an operation the following 
  day, the Sunday. On that Saturday I prepared the petrol bombs. On Sunday, 25 
  July 1993, we met at the Uluntu community centre in Guguletu. This time Makoma 
  was also with us. We met between eleven and twelve noon. At this point Nonxuba 
  told me that I was going to be part of the operation. He still had not told 
  me what the nature of the operation was, what the target would be or what time 
  it would take place. We were told to meet again at 6 pm at the Langa taxi rank. 
  I was ordered to bring along the petrol bombs. When I got to the Langa taxi 
  rank before 6pm Nonxuba was already there and I noticed that he had brought 
  the bag which I had brought from the Transkei. A little later Mlambisa and Makoma 
  arrived in a Datsun motor vehicle. When I got into the car, the Commander of 
  the operation, Nonxuba, said that we were going to the target. He still did 
  not reveal any details of what the target was going to be. I was told that I 
  would be the security, Mlambisa the driver. I was sitting in front with Mlambisa. 
  Nonxuba and Makoma were going inside. After they came out of the building I 
  was to use the petrol bombs to throw them inside. As Mlambisa drove, Nonxuba 
  was giving him directions as to how to drive and where to drive. It is only 
  when we got to the place which was identified by Nonxuba as the target did I 
  realise that it was the St James church. We had circled the church about three 
  times. There were many cars and it appeared as if there were many people inside 
  the church. Mlambisa drove into the parking area at the church and parked approximately 
  10 metres from the entrance to the church. Mlambisa reversed the car so that 
  the back was facing the entrance. Nonxuba and Makoma got out, each one armed 
  with a rifle and a grenade. They then entered the church. I heard a grenade 
  and gunshots and then saw a red car stopping in front of us, apparently to block 
  us. I got out of the car and threw a petrol bomb at the car and Mlambisa got 
  out and shot at the car, causing the car to speed away. Then Nonxuba and Makoma 
  came out of the church, jumped into the car and we immediately sped away. I 
  did not do what I was supposed to do, that is to throw the petrol bombs inside 
  the church. I do not know what happened inside the church, but I am fully aware 
  that with the arms and ammunition carried by Makoma and Nonxuba, that people 
  would be killed or injured. When we were in the car and making our getaway, 
  Makoma said that someone had shot at him inside the church and that he was bleeding, 
  but neither Makoma, nor Nonxuba said what happened inside the church. Nonxuba 
  did, however, ask why I did not throw the petrol bomb and then I explained to 
  him why I did not do so. We then drove to a place under the direction of Nonxuba. 
  I later learned that this place is called Ottery. Mlambisa and I left Nonxuba 
  and Makoma there at a house in Ottery with the weapons. Mlambisa and I took 
  the car to a scrap yard in Ottery, left it there and returned to this house 
  on foot. We slept at the house that night. That same night, we watched the news 
  on CNN and I saw for the first time what happened inside the church. On the 
  Monday morning Nonxuba and I took a bus to Wynberg and from there a taxi to 
  Guguletu. Nonxuba got out in Guguletu and I went home to Old Crossroads with 
  a taxi. I stayed at home for a while and I left to go to New Crossroads to my 
  cousin's place. There I laid low for a short while, but then after a week or 
  two, when I heard that Makoma had been arrested, I left for the Transkei by 
  bus. I stayed in Umtata in a safe house. I was arrested in February 1996 in 
  connection with the St James case, but I was already in custody after being 
  arrested on 1 November 1995 in connection with an armed robbery which allegedly 
  took place in Crossroads. This case against me has now been withdrawn. I deeply 
  regret the loss of life which occurred as a result of the operation of which 
  I was a part on Sunday the 25th of July 1993. At the time I was 17 years old 
  and I followed the orders that I was given without questioning it. I was very 
  impressionable then and regarded the older APLA operators such as Nonxuba as 
  heroes. I wish to ask the family, relatives and friends of the deceased and 
  other victims who were injured, for forgiveness. I respectfully submit that 
  my application complies with the requirements of the Act, that the offences 
  which I committed and associated myself with, were offences associated with 
  the political objective, committed in the course of the conflicts of the past 
  and that it accords with the provisions of Section 22 and 23 of the Act and 
  that I have made full disclosure of all the relevant facts relating to the St 
  James incident, which is within my personal knowledge. Accordingly, I respectfully 
  request that I be granted amnesty in respect of those offences relating to the 
  St James incident". And it is signed by Bassie Nzikizi Mkhumbuzi and it 
  was signed on the 7th of July 1997. JUDGE NGOEPE: Mr Mkhumbuzi, will 
  you stand up please? CHAIRMAN: Swear him in, Sisi. 
  BASSIE NZIKIZI MKHUMBUZI: (sworn states) MS KHAMPEPE: You have been 
  properly sworn in, you may sit down. CHAIRMAN: You have heard your counsel 
  read your affidavit, did you understand it? Do you confirm the contents of that 
  affidavit? MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I do confirm. CHAIRMAN: Are there 
  any questions Mr Arendse, you wish to put to the witness?  ADV ARENDSE: 
  No, Mr Chairman. CHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge, do you wish to question this 
  witness? ADV BEMBRIDGE: I do Judge. Mr Brink has suggested however, that 
  I first get some guidance from the Committee on one aspect. We have in our possession 
  certain statements which were made by Mr Makoma, confessions which were made 
  to the police which were ruled inadmissible at the hearing, the criminal hearing 
  in this matter. It would seem to me that in light of the fact that the applicants 
  now intend to confess to their participation in these events, that the contents 
  of these statements are no longer inadmissible on the basis that they were inadmissible 
  at the trial, that they would appear to some extent, in any event, to be correct. 
  Mr Brink, has however suggested that I put to the Committee or ask for the Committee's 
  guidance as to what their admissibility would be particularly with a view to 
  cross-examination in these proceedings. CHAIRMAN: It seems Mr Bembridge 
  you will have to clear the groundwork with Mr Makoma first to establish whether 
  this was his statement, whether it was made freely and voluntarily, whether 
  any pressure or any violence was exerted on him at the time and matters of that 
  kind. ADV BEMBRIDGE: That certainly may be the case, however, the difficulty 
  now is that certain of the contents of that statement, may be relevant with 
  respect to this applicant. ADV DE JAGER: On what grounds was it decided 
  that it was not admissible? ADV BEMBRIDGE: It was decided, no it is not 
  correct to say it was decided that he was assaulted, the court specifically 
  found that the accused as he was in those proceedings, had not been assaulted, 
  it was found however, that due to the length of the interrogations and perhaps 
  the time of day and factors like that, although it cannot per se be said 
  that he had been induced into making statements against his will, that the manner 
  in which the interrogations were held, was not the best manner and there may 
  have been some emotional stress on him at the time, which may have perhaps induced 
  him to say things which he otherwise may not have said. But it was not found 
  that the interrogations per se were improper or ... ADV DE JAGER: 
  But wouldn't that be also the case here then, why should this differ if it was 
  inadmissible on the grounds of long interrogations or legally inadmissible, 
  why ... ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, I would submit that it could be relevant 
  to the extent that it now appears that the applicants will admit largely that 
  what they said in those statements, is correct, which was categorically denied 
  in the criminal proceedings. Now it appears that they admit that what the nature 
  of the confession was largely speaking, completely correct. CHAIRMAN: 
  Well, in that case, you will have to deal with it like my brother is suggesting 
  to you, in fact I initially misunderstood, I thought that it was his own statement, 
  now you say it was Mr Makoma's statement. ADV BEMBRIDGE: That is right. 
  CHAIRMAN: You can do no more than if you have that statement, which was 
  made by Mr Makoma where he refers to this particular witness, the best for you, 
  you can do no more than ask this gentleman and say to him, in a statement which 
  Mr Makoma disowned, he said you did this and this, is it true? If he says it 
  is true, then you have no problem, but if he says it is not true, then you can't 
  take it any further. But you will have to deal with it, not with pertinent questions, 
  you will have to single out statement by statement, you may not say to him so 
  and so made a statement, is that statement not true, that is what I am referring 
  to when I say not a pertinent questions. You will have to deal with the statement 
  sentence by sentence to be on a proper footing. JUDGE NGOEPE: The evidential 
  value of all that is something which we will have to decide at, at the appropriate 
  stage. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV BEMBRIDGE: I appreciate the Committee's guidance 
  on that. Mr Mkhumbuzi, can you tell me when did you first become a member of 
  APLA itself? MR MKHUMBUZI: In November 1992, but I am not sure about 
  the date. ADV BEMBRIDGE: And how were you recruited to that organisation? 
  MR MKHUMBUZI: As a member of the PAC, I knew that there was a military 
  wing of the PAC, which is APLA. I was interested in joining or being a member 
  of APLA. In the activities I have done, I was an organiser and I met these people, 
  I then joined APLA. ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was in fact the procedure for 
  joining APLA, was there any formal procedure or any formal steps that you had 
  to take?  MR MKHUMBUZI: No, there was no procedure in joining APLA except 
  that if you wanted to be a member, and if you believed to what we believed in, 
  if you wanted to be a member of APLA, you became a member of APLA, so there 
  was no procedure to follow in order to join APLA. If you wanted to join, you 
  would join. ADV BEMBRIDGE: But what did you join, did you have to tell 
  someone I am now joining APLA or how did this transition from being an ordinary 
  member of the PAC to becoming a member of APLA take place? MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  What I did, I used to attend PAC meetings. I was AZANYO organiser and I always 
  heard about APLA soldiers but I couldn't contact and meet them. They would come 
  to PAC members and I found out about that after a long time, that they would 
  attend PAC meetings and listen to the meeting and to the procedures. And they 
  would pick up right persons, that is how they recruited people to join APLA. 
  You would not just come and say you want to be a member of APLA. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How did your training with APLA begin? MR MKHUMBUZI: I can say that I 
  was a member of the Task Force. I was working for the Task Force. From there 
  there were known contacts who were known to the leaders of the Task Force. From 
  there you would be a member of APLA. ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was the purpose 
  of this Task Force? MR MKHUMBUZI: The purpose of the Task Force was to 
  protect and to defend PAC members. Those who were working on the ground. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I just want to refer you to the plea of Mr Makoma which he made 
  when, in the criminal trial in which he was prosecuted. It is at page 5 of the 
  bundle for the purposes of the Committee. I don't know whether the applicant 
  in fact requires a copy for him, otherwise I can just read to him the section 
  to which I am going to refer. JUDGE NGOEPE: Is it a lengthy passage you 
  want him to consider? ADV BEMBRIDGE: It is a passage of about four lines. 
  JUDGE NGOEPE: Well, just put it to him. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Okay. In 
  his statement to the court, Mr Makoma said that in and during 1993, PAC members 
  were attacked by members of rival political organisations. He said this led 
  to the formation of the Task Group under the leadership of Siphiwe Makweso and 
  this group was specifically informed to protect PAC leaders and members, do 
  you confirm that that is correct what he says?CHAIRMAN: I can't find 
  that. ADV BEMBRIDGE: It is at page 5 of the bundle, Judge. CHAIRMAN: 
  Your bundle? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Which we handed up to the court, I beg your 
  pardon. ADV DE JAGER: Typed page 5. The 5, typed? ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  It is amongst the bundle of documents which we've handed up in the file. ADV 
  DE JAGER: Ours are not numbered, as far as I can see. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  There should be numbering on the top, right hand side of the page. MS KHAMPEPE: 
  Mr Bembridge, is it not on page 4 of the plea examination, if some documents 
  have not been paginated?ADV BEMBRIDGE: It is typed page 4, and marked 
  page 5 on the top right hand corner. It is page 4 of the plea explanation, but 
  page 5 of the total bundle which we've handed up.CHAIRMAN: Yes.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Where on that page is this, Mr Bembridge?ADV BEMBRIDGE: It 
  is at the paragraph marked 20.JUDGE NGOEPE: Line 20?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  It begins slightly earlier than line 20, but...MS KHAMPEPE: Line 16.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Yes, at the middle of the page?ADV BEMBRIDGE: That is correct.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Yes, just give him another chance, read that to him.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Mr Makoma stated in his plea to the court that in and during 1993, PAC members 
  were attacked by members of rival political organisations. This led to the formation 
  of a Task Group under the leadership of Siphiwe Makweso. This group was specifically 
  formed to protect PAC leaders and members. Do you confirm that that is correct?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Yes, that is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: So then is it correct 
  to say also that the Task Group of which you were a member, was designed to 
  protect the PAC from its opponents?MR MKHUMBUZI: The Task Force was to 
  protect the PAC members.ADV BEMBRIDGE: It was not designed to go out 
  and attack other people, it was designed as a defensive unit, is that correct?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No, it was not to attack, but I can say that in defending or 
  protecting members in the Task Force, there were different structures. Although 
  some of the people were not aware of those structures, my information is that 
  the Task Force was there to protect or defend members of the PAC.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And it was there to protect the members against as it states, attacks by members 
  of rival political organisations? Is that correct?MR MKHUMBUZI: I said 
  that what I knew about the Task Force is that it protected PAC members.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Did you consider the congregation at the St James church as a 
  rival political organisation which posed some threat to your members and leaders?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Please explain your question how?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I want 
  to know did you see the congregation of the St James church as a rival political 
  organisation which threatened your members or leaders and which it was therefore 
  necessary for you to defend them against? INTERPRETER: If I may interject 
  Mr Chairman, there isn't proper interpretation of the word "threat", 
  I think the misunderstanding between the person who is asking the question and 
  the applicant is as a result of a failure to interpret appropriately the word 
  "threat".ADV BEMBRIDGE: Perhaps I can rephrase my question 
  Committee. Did you see the congregation of the St James church as a rival political 
  organisation which may attack your members and leaders?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Will you please repeat the question, it is not clear to me?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Did you see or did you consider the members of the congregation at the St James 
  church as people who would, who were a rival political organisation to the PAC 
  and who may attack the members or leaders of the PAC?MR MKHUMBUZI: My 
  answer to that - people from Azania, when the land was taken from them by the 
  Whites, they were using churches in all means. They were using the churches.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: How were they using the churches to attack the PAC?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  I did not say they were using churches to attack PAC, I talked about when they 
  took the land from the people. The land which we wanted - so they were using 
  churches in all means.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you or do you not say that the 
  church was being used to attack the PAC?MR MKHUMBUZI: The question is 
  not clear when you ask about the church.CHAIRMAN: Sorry, did you hear 
  him say that, I did not hear him say that. I never heard him say that the church 
  was used to attack the PAC.ADV BEMBRIDGE: My question is whether he says 
  it or whether he does not say it.CHAIRMAN: Well, he hasn't. On what basis 
  do you ask that question if he hasn't said that. Is it a wrong interpretation 
  or what? ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am asking him whether it is his opinion that 
  the church was used to attack the PAC, he doesn't seem to understand my question, 
  I am trying to put it in a slightly more basic form, to say to him, is it his 
  opinion that the church attacked the PAC or is it not his opinion.MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Will you please repeat that question for me?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is it or is 
  it not your opinion that the church was used to attack the PAC?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Again I am saying that I did not say that churches were used to attack PAC.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Then on what basis do you justify the Task Force from attacking 
  the church?MR MKHUMBUZI: I don't remember mentioning a Task Force attacking 
  a church.MS KHAMPEPE: May I interpose Mr Bembridge? I think what Mr Mkhumbuzi 
  has said is that he was a member of the Task Force which was formed to protect 
  and defend members of the PAC. The evidence that has been admitted through the 
  affidavit indicates that the church was attacked by him whilst he was a member 
  of APLA, shouldn't you by tying the two before you can put that question to 
  him? Was a Task Force a unit of APLA?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, I attempted 
  to clarify that with him earlier when I asked him the manner in which he joined 
  APLA, he explained he joined APLA by joining the Task Force as I understood 
  him.JUDGE NGOEPE: That is how it started, but the actual attack may have 
  taken place at a time when he was not merely a member of the Task Force, but 
  as a member of APLA and according to his evidence as I understand it, it was 
  APLA that attacked the church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Then I think I am obliged 
  to ask him again how he became a member of APLA.JUDGE NGOEPE: I don't 
  think that is really necessary, you are taking up a lot of time, because the 
  fact of the matter is that PAC - who is a member of PAC knows that APLA is a 
  military wing of the PAC, he was recruited into APLA, I don't think we should 
  take too much time over that. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well he says he was recruited 
  into APLA, it appears at this stage only that he was recruited into the Task 
  Force.JUDGE NGOEPE: Quite right.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He did not have 
  any of the functions which would justify the attack on the church.JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  At the time when the attack took place, he may have been not only in the Task 
  Force, but as a member of APLA, clear that up. Perhaps I should clear it up. 
  You joined APLA as a member of the Task Force.MR MKHUMBUZI: I joined 
  APLA while I was a member of the Task Force.JUDGE NGOEPE: While you were 
  a member of the Task Force, is that how it is? Yes?MR MKHUMBUZI: I am 
  sorry, come again?JUDGE NGOEPE: While you were a member of the Task Force, 
  you joined APLA?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I joined APLA.JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  So then the attack was not carried out by the Task Force, it was carried out 
  by APLA?ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did you make this transition from being a 
  mere Task Force member to being a member of APLA?MR MKHUMBUZI: As I've 
  already said before, in our meetings, PAC meetings, AZANYO meetings and Task 
  Force meetings, there would be APLA members, although we were not aware of that. 
  It would happen that they will pick right people, those who they saw a right 
  people. They will approach you in a certain way, but you would not be aware 
  of that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were the other people who went with you on attack, 
  all members of APLA?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, everybody who was there.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: How do you know that?MR MKHUMBUZI: I know because we would 
  be in APLA meetings together.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who was the person who gave 
  you your orders regarding training?MR MKHUMBUZI: I was trained by a man 
  who came here by the name of Vusi, that is the name I know.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And what role did Mr Makoma play as a trainer?MR MKHUMBUZI: We were training 
  together, we were doing physical training together. Roadworks and all that training.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: So Mr Makoma was not your trainer, he merely trained with you?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: We were training together.ADV BEMBRIDGE: So if I refer 
  to paragraph 8 of your affidavit, then there is a mistake there in that it says 
  Mr Makoma was a trainer of APLA, then that is not correct? MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  How did you ask the question before?ADV DE JAGER: Couldn't a trainer 
  be training together with you, running with you, training with you, although 
  he is in charge of the operation, the training operation?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  That is possible, I think however, it is an important distinction and we must 
  ascertain which one it was.JUDGE NGOEPE: I don't understand whether you 
  are challenging his membership of APLA, or whether you are challenging Makoma's 
  membership of APLA, because if you are not ...JUDGE WILSON: No, Makoma 
  was an trainer, now he says he wasn't. What you are challenging isn't it, is 
  that in his affidavit he said I was a member of the APLA unit of which Makoma 
  was a trainer, he has now said Makoma trained with me, I was trained by somebody 
  else.ADV BEMBRIDGE: That is correct, that is what I am trying to clarify 
  in any event.MS KHAMPEPE: Mr Bembridge, shouldn't you probably try and 
  ascertain from the witness what kind of training was given by this man called 
  Vusi?ADV BEMBRIDGE: That may be a relevant factor, but I think firstly 
  it is important to establish what Mr Makoma's function was, was he a trainer 
  in the sense of having some authority over this applicant or was he merely a 
  co-trainee.JUDGE NGOEPE: Put it to him that in his affidavit it is said 
  that Makoma was a trainer, ask him whether that is correct or incorrect.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Was Mr Makoma your trainer, did he have authority over you, or 
  was he merely someone who trained with you?MR MKHUMBUZI: I would like 
  to ask a question. Which training are you asking about, because we were training 
  together with Makoma doing physical training.JUDGE WILSON: Did Makoma 
  train you in any sphere? MR MKHUMBUZI: It is not clear to me, to train 
  me how because he was a trainer in physical training.JUDGE WILSON: What 
  do you mean by that, did he show you how to do things?MR MKHUMBUZI: We 
  were training together, because in physical training we would come with different 
  exercises.JUDGE WILSON: Who would show you the exercises? Who would tell 
  you what to do?MR MKHUMBUZI: In physical training, each person would 
  come with his or her exercise because nobody would know each and every physical 
  exercises available, one would come with a different physical exercise and we 
  would do it all together.JUDGE NGOEPE: You see, I want to read to you 
  a sentence from your affidavit which says I was a member of an APLA unit of 
  which Makoma was a trainer, is that correct?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, that is 
  correct.JUDGE NGOEPE: Right, you may carry on from there.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you. Am I correct in saying that the person you knew as Vusi, was your 
  superior, he was the one who was the most superior person responsible for your 
  training?MR MKHUMBUZI: Which training?CHAIRMAN: Any training that 
  you can think of. Why are we engaging in this kind of hair splitting exercise, 
  any kind of training.MR MKHUMBUZI: I can say that Vusi was training us, 
  he was the one training us, was the one giving us military training. JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Let's move a little faster than that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And in 
  that training you trained with Mr Makoma as well?MR MKHUMBUZI: In military 
  training?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Yes.MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Is Vusi the same person known as Nonxuba?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You don't know? Did Vusi go on the attack with you to St James?MS KHAMPEPE: 
  Mr Bembridge, I think the explanation was it is not Vusi.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Oh, yes.MS KHAMPEPE: Not, that he doesn't know. I hope you got the right 
  translation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I got the translation he doesn't know. MS 
  KHAMPEPE: It is incorrect, what he said was "no, Vusi wasn't."ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: And Vusi, he did go on the attack with you though?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  No, he was not.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He was not on the attack.MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When you were instructed about this operation you were 
  to go to, which you say you were later told to go to the Transkei and collect 
  weapons for, who told you about that operation?MR MKHUMBUZI: I was told 
  by Vusi.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And you say he told you nothing about the operation?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No, he did not.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you discuss this with 
  Makoma at any time?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I didn't.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You 
  were training together, but you didn't discuss anything about this proposed 
  operation between each other? MR MKHUMBUZI: I don't remember.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  So you may have discussed between each other, you just don't remember?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: We did not discuss anything apart from discussing within that 
  week that there was going to be a certain mission, before that week, we did 
  not discuss anything about St James.ADV BEMBRIDGE: In that week, did 
  you discuss St James?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, we did not discuss anything about 
  St James.JUDGE WILSON: I think you said during that week, we did discuss 
  about a certain mission. Is that so, there was going to be a mission?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And what did you discuss? Did you discuss what the 
  type of mission was going to be?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, we did not discuss 
  that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What did you then discuss about the mission?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: We did not discuss anything about the mission, but we were told 
  that there was going to be a mission.ADV BEMBRIDGE: As I understood you, 
  you said in the week preceding the mission, you did discuss it. CHAIRMAN: 
  I think the word "discuss", might have conveyed a wrong meaning, you 
  know. They were told that there was going to be a mission. I think that is what 
  he is trying to convey.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you talk to Makoma about the 
  mission at all?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why not?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  I did not know anything about the mission, so there was nothing to say.JUDGE 
  WILSON: Well, did Makoma talk to you about the mission?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  He said that there was going to be a mission.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And did you 
  ask him anything about it?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, there was nothing I can ask.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: What do you mean there is nothing you could ask, you could ask 
  what the mission would be, surely you could ask where the mission would be? 
  You could ask him all those questions? Were you not interested?JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  Well, the fact of the matter is that he didn't ask. Isn't that enough?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I think not, with respect Judge, he says he didn't ask, but that 
  is highly unlikely in the circumstances and I think he is not being truthful 
  on that issue. JUDGE NGOEPE: Is there any evidence that you have, that 
  contradicts that?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, with respect, we can't present 
  evidence on that behalf, we are appearing for the victims in this matter, it 
  is however unlikely and I think this is a point on which it can be suggested 
  that this person is not making a full disclosure of what he knew.CHAIRMAN: 
  Well, you can argue that, although one view may be that it is likely that he 
  would not have been, I mean for security reasons, those details they might not 
  be disclosed to these guys beforehand, especially in operation of this nature.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Details may not have been disclosed, but I think it is highly 
  unlikely that he would not at all have discussed this mission that he says he 
  was aware of.MS KHAMPEPE: Maybe Mr Bembridge, that was part of his training, 
  they were not trained to ask details about the operation, until when they were 
  told.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can I put this to you Mr Mkhumbuzi, Mr Makoma in 
  the statements which I earlier discussed with the Committee, which he disputes, 
  which he says were made to the police under interrogation, he said that he was 
  told by Vusi a long time, at least a week before the mission took place, that 
  the mission was to be at a church in Kenilworth. Did he never tell you anything 
  of that nature?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, he did not.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did 
  he tell you whether he knew or did not know anything about the mission?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Who ware you talking about?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr Makoma.MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Please repeat your question. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did Mr Makoma 
  say to you that he did not know any of the details of the mission, did he say 
  to you that he did know any of the details of the mission?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  I did not ask him when he told me about the mission, so he could not tell me 
  anything, what kind of a mission was it because I did not ask him.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Why did you not ask, were you not interested?MR MKHUMBUZI: I could not 
  ask him.CHAIRMAN: Why? The question is why?MR MKHUMBUZI: What 
  I knew was that if you got an order, you had to follow that order, you don't 
  have to ask question concerning that order. You just have to listen to the person 
  who is giving you an order.JUDGE WILSON: You haven't suggested for one 
  minute that Mr Makoma was giving you an order. I can understand you not questioning 
  an order, but all you've told us is that Mr Makoma who is a friend of yours, 
  who was training with you, told you that there was going to be a mission. Surely 
  you would want to know from him, what sort of mission, what do we have to do?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I did not want to know more, because I knew that we were trained 
  for such operations. I did not want to know any more details when he told me.MS 
  KHAMPEPE: What was Mr Makoma's function in your unit?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  I knew Mr Makoma, he would come at home and visit me, but I am not aware of 
  his function, but I knew that he was a member like APLA, just like myself.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You did however do your training together, so you knew him? MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I knew him.ADV DE JAGER: Did you have ranks in APLA?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No, I did not have a rank.ADV DE JAGER: You didn't have 
  a rank, did Mr Makoma have a rank?MR MKHUMBUZI: He did not tell me of 
  having a rank, I don't think he had a rank in APLA.ADV DE JAGER: Was 
  he on the same level, a soldier on the same level or was he on a higher level?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: We were in the same level according to my knowledge. He was not 
  giving orders to me, we were just advising each other.MS KHAMPEPE: When 
  Mr Mkhumbuzi, in your affidavit, that at paragraph 10, I think that is what 
  Mr Bembridge is struggling with, when you say you were instructed by Mr Makoma 
  to prepare yourself by getting yourself into physical position, what do you 
  mean by that? If you were on par with Mr Makoma and he wasn't in a position 
  to be able to give you instructions or orders in your unit?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  When I mentioned this in my statement, I meant that we could get a message maybe 
  from Makoma, we could get a message through Makoma from the Commander or they 
  can get a message through me from the Commander, maybe it happened this way 
  that day.JUDGE NGOEPE: Yes, do carry on.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you. 
  Well, the question is how did it happen? Not maybe how it happened, you said 
  in your statement specifically that it was Mr Makoma who came and told you to 
  make preparations for the operation, however now in your testimony you say that 
  you didn't discuss the matter at all with Mr Makoma, now which one of the two 
  is it?MR MKHUMBUZI: Your question is not clear to me. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  In paragraph 10 of your statement, you say that it was about a week before the 
  attack that Mr Makoma came to you and told you that the operation was going 
  to take place and to make preparations, you say he told you to prepare yourself 
  by getting into top physical condition and that you were to go and get weapons 
  from Umtata.JUDGE WILSON: He doesn't say that. He instructed me to prepare 
  into top physical state, that is him, but he then goes on to say and more importantly 
  ...ADV BEMBRIDGE: I beg your pardon, that is correct. I am sorry, I misread 
  that. You do say however in your statement that Mr Makoma told you to prepare 
  yourself for the operation and to get yourself into top physical condition. 
  But in your evidence now, you say you didn't discuss the matter or talked to 
  Mr Makoma about the operation at all.CHAIRMAN: That is not necessarily 
  inconsistent you know. They did not talk about what they were going to do, he 
  was just told that he must prepare himself for whatever they were going to do. 
  Isn't that what it really means?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, I asked him when 
  he said that they didn't discuss the objectives, what they did then speak about 
  regarding the operation. He said that they didn't really speak at all.CHAIRMAN:	
  Quite right. He just told him you better get ready.MS KHAMPEPE: I have 
  him saying Mr Bembridge that the details of the actual operation were not discussed, 
  but Mr Makoma gave him instructions to do certain things, which included getting 
  himself into a proper physical condition for the mission. But the details of 
  the mission per se were not discussed by Makoma.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  That is his suggestion certainly. I submit however, that that is not consistent 
  with what he had been saying in his testimony.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who is the 
  person who actually gave you the order to go to Umtata and collect the weapons?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I said it was Vusi. ADV BEMBRIDGE: It was Vusi, and what 
  exactly did he say to you?MR MKHUMBUZI: He told me to go to Umtata, to 
  a certain house in Umtata, he gave me the address. There I would meet a person 
  and that person would know why I was there.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Again, you 
  didn't ask him any reason for this?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I did not.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You arrived back in Cape Town after collecting the ammunition 
  and you took them to a house you say. Thereafter you had certain meetings, one 
  at the Uluntu community centre with a person called Nonxuba, who is that?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Nonxuba was the person who was present in the church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And what did he instruct you?MR MKHUMBUZI: When?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  When you saw him at Uluntu community centre?MR MKHUMBUZI: I said that 
  he told me to prepare petrol bombs, known as Molatov, we were then going to 
  meet in the morning on Sunday.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He didn't give any reason 
  as to why?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, he did not give me any reason. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And again you were not interested to ask?MR MKHUMBUZI: I could not ask.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: When you got into the car to proceed to the actual operation 
  itself, you still didn't ask him where you were going?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, 
  I did not ask. But what I knew was that we were going to an operation. That 
  is what I was thinking.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why didn't you ask him what the 
  operation was and where you were going?MR MKHUMBUZI: I could not ask.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Why could you not ask?MR MKHUMBUZI: What I knew was that 
  I had to follow orders as they came. I could not ask anything more. I was just 
  following orders.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who told you that, that you were not 
  allowed to ask any questions?MR MKHUMBUZI: I was told by Vusi, the one 
  who was training me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did he tell Makoma that too?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I don't know whether he told Makoma. ADV BEMBRIDGE: If 
  he told you as part of your training, then I presume that Mr Makoma would have 
  been told at the same time?JUDGE NGOEPE: Is that a question?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Perhaps I can rephrase it. If Vusi told you that as part of your training, was 
  Mr Makoma told at the same time or was he not told at the same time?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  I would like to explain something.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Please go ahead.MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Mr Makoma was staying at his home, I was staying at home. We 
  would meet in meetings, but what I am sure about is that Vusi told me that Makoma 
  was together with us in the same training. If he told me not to ask, it is clear 
  that he also told Makoma.JUDGE WILSON: Did he tell you privately or did 
  he tell you when he had the people there that he was training?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  My training was private. CHAIRMAN: Was that part of your training that 
  you mustn't ask questions?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, it was part of my training.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Do you know now, whether anyone had been to the St James church 
  before the attack to plan the operation? Do you know that now? MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  No, I don't know.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was your training as to attacks, 
  was it not part of your training that attacks should be carefully planned?CHAIRMAN:	
  You mean planned by him?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am saying was it part of his 
  training that attacks in general should be carefully planned by whoever was 
  to be in control of that operation?MR MKHUMBUZI: Please repeat your question.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Do you know whether attacks are properly planned beforehand?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I do know that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You don't know whether 
  this specific attack was properly planned though?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I 
  don't.ADV BEMBRIDGE: In all likelihood according to what you have been 
  told in your training, it had been planned?CHAIRMAN: ... along with the 
  question that the comment you are making, you know, the likelihood of him being 
  told and so on, I mean that really hardly is a question.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I won't take it any further. Had you heard of the St James church before the 
  attack took place? MR MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where did you 
  live at the time?MR MKHUMBUZI: At home.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where is 
  that or where was that?MR MKHUMBUZI: Unathi, in Old Crossroads, number 
  2023.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were you aware of the St James' activities in Khayelitsha?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You were not aware that St James has 
  a daughter church in Khayelitsha?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You were not aware that the congregation from St James, Kenilworth, on Sundays 
  go to church in that church in Khayelitsha?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I did not 
  know.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can I take it you knew nothing about the St James 
  church before the attack? MR MKHUMBUZI: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What 
  was then your objective in forming part of that attack?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  Please explain your question.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was your intention in 
  forming part of that attack? What did you expect the attack to achieve?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I took part in the attack so that our land can come back to us 
  and so that there can be democracy in this country.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How 
  did you intend the attack to achieve that?MR MKHUMBUZI: According to 
  me, this attack would bring down the spirit of the oppressors in order for us 
  to think back what they have done to see that it was not a good thing to take 
  the land from its people.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How would it bring down the oppressors?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: When there is violence in White areas, they would try and go 
  to the government to lay there grievances so that the government can listen 
  to our own grievances in order for us to live together in peace.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And that was your intention or your reason for taking part in the attack?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I can say so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But Mr Mkhumbuzi, when 
  you decided to take part in that attack, you just said you didn't know the attack 
  was going to be in a White area. CHAIRMAN: No, you asked him questions, 
  what did he hope to achieve and he gave you a general answer as to how he understood 
  the position. You can't take it very much further than that, can you?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: With respect, he said his motivation for taking part in the attack 
  was to perform an attack on a White area, yet he said he didn't know that prior 
  to him actually deciding to go on the attack.CHAIRMAN: Quite right. They 
  attacked a White church and you asked him what were you hoping to achieve? He 
  offers you an explanation as to what he thought, if there was violence in a 
  White area, the government would pay attention to their grievances.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  With respect, what I asked him was what was his motivation for going on the 
  operation.CHAIRMAN: Well, maybe that is putting it differently, but I 
  think the answer is the same, isn't it?ADV BEMBRIDGE: With respect, I 
  would submit not. I submit his motivation for going on the operation is formed 
  prior to going on the operation. He said that his motivation was to attack a 
  White area.CHAIRMAN: His motivation was that he wasn't told, he was merely 
  told he was to be part of an operation, that is all.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Specifically 
  that is the point I am trying to make. I am saying he is not being truthful 
  in saying that.CHAIRMAN: Well, suggest to him that you knew all along 
  that there was going to be an attack on the church and despite that, you went, 
  put that to him.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Certainly, Judge, if I put that to him, 
  however, if I put that to him as bluntly as that, he is likely to deny it straight 
  up.JUDGE NGOEPE: My problem is that you take that question out of context. 
  Out of the context of PAC APLA operations, and you singled it out as a small 
  little trip that has to be considered on its own. You ignore the whole context 
  which he has given us that I was a member of this, I was a member of this military 
  wing operating this way and that way and then you singled it out and you take 
  it out of that general context and then you put it in isolation there. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I don't seem to put it in isolation, however, it is clear if 
  what he says is true, he couldn't have been aware that that would be the effect 
  of the attack, it may for all he knew, have been an attack on an ANC position 
  which would not have had the effect which he says is would have had.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: What was the general objective of APLA, the military wing?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: That I can't speak for on behalf of APLA, but certainly it would 
  seem that their activities ...JUDGE NGOEPE: Well, hasn't the applicant 
  told us what it was all about?ADV BEMBRIDGE: It also seems to be that 
  he was also involved in organisations which carried out defensive duties.MS 
  KHAMPEPE: But with due respect, Mr Bembridge, that is the point that you 
  actually covered, I think you went back to that point repeatedly. The Task Force 
  he referred to was indeed a defensive unit, but the APLA unit that he has given 
  evidence to, was definitely something completely different to the Task Force, 
  but he initially referred to he was recruited from the Task Force whose duty 
  then was to defend the community. He was recruited from that Force into the 
  APLA unit which had a completely different function from the Task Force, that 
  is the evidence which is before us.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Perhaps I should ask 
  him then what was the purpose of APLA at the time?MR MKHUMBUZI: The purpose 
  of the APLA at the time was to fight until the land was brought back to its 
  owners.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who was that fight against?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  The land was taken by the White people, those who oppressed us at the time. 
  It is clear that we were fighting against them.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did the 
  PAC or APLA have any other enemies at the time? MR MKHUMBUZI: No. I don't 
  think so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did the PAC ever, or APLA ever launch attacks 
  on other political parties?MR MKHUMBUZI: I did not hear even in the news 
  about that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were you aware of the nature of the weapons 
  that were going to be used in this attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: I knew about 
  the weapons that they would injure people, but I did not know that it would 
  be people in church. But I knew that the weapons were there to injure people.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Did you know that handgrenades with nails glued to them, would 
  be used in the attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: The handgrenades together with other 
  weapons, I was told to take a suitcase and I was told what was inside the suitcase, 
  but I did not open the suitcase to see whether there were handgrenades, but 
  these were written down that in this suitcase, there are such and such weapons. 
  I had to give them back to the person who sent me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You 
  didn't look inside and see for yourself?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I did not.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You say now you think it was wrong to attack the church if I 
  understood you correctly?MR MKHUMBUZI: Now?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I thought 
  you have said a moment ago that you think it was wrong to have attacked the 
  church? You don't think that? MR MKHUMBUZI: I don't remember saying that.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Okay, what is your attitude now then to having attacked the church?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I sympathise with the people who died in the church and I would 
  like to ask for forgiveness to them. But we could not stop what was happening 
  at that time, we could not stop it at that time. But now there is peace.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Why could you not stop it at the time?MR MKHUMBUZI: As 
  I've already said at that time we were fighting for our country and for democracy. 
  It was very difficult at the time to stop such incidents because this country, 
  we were oppressed in this country, South Africa, we could not at all.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Do you think the attack achieved anything?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes, I think so because today we are in this country South Africa, we are living 
  together. We are not fighting with each other, we are here today to this Truth 
  Commission to give or to explain what we have done before.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Were you aware that there were negotiations going on about the new constitution 
  at that time?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I would listen to the news and I would 
  hear about the negotiations.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Was that not a better way 
  of achieving peace and democracy? MR MKHUMBUZI: The PAC did not see it 
  that way at that time. But it was an easy way because it did not tell APLA to 
  stop fighting with the Whites at the time.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you have 
  any knowledge of why APLA denied responsibility for the attack at the time?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No, I don't have that knowledge.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you 
  think it was in accordance with the PAC policy at the time to carry out that 
  attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: I think so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you explain 
  then why the PAC said it was not?MR MKHUMBUZI: It was not what?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: That it was not in accordance with their policy?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Would you like me to explain why the PAC ..ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am asking 
  you if you know why the PAC said that that attack was not in accordance with 
  their policy and why they condemned the attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I am 
  sorry, I don't know why they condemned that, maybe they can explain why they 
  deny it. I for one, I cannot explain.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Are you aware that 
  the PAC was participating in the negotiations about the new constitution? MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Which one are you talking about, which negotiations are you talking 
  about?ADV BEMBRIDGE: The negotiations that were taking place about the 
  very same that that attack was carried out, over the new constitution?ADV 
  DE JAGER: Wasn't it almost like the Prestasie advertisement - "strengthen 
  our negotiating arm?"ADV BEMBRIDGE: That may be, I am asking if 
  he is aware that there was negotiations going on. Negotiations in Kempton Park?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I would listen to the news and see this in the news, but I did 
  not get a report about what PAC said in the negotiations.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  What did you do after the attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: After the attack, I went 
  to stay with my cousin and then from there, I went to the Transkei.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Did you report back to anyone, any of your superiors as to what had happened?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: What do you mean, where in the Transkei?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Anywhere, in Cape Town or in the Transkei, did you report to anyone what had 
  happened at the attack, anyone at APLA?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I told no one.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: So therefore you spoke to no one about the attack before it took 
  place, you spoke to no one about the attack after it took place? MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But you went as far as preparing petrol bombs, carrying 
  weapons, all this for an attack which you knew nothing about?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I want to put it to you Mr Mkhumbuzi, that you are 
  not telling the truth, that you were aware, well before this attack took place 
  what the target was, that you were aware that it was a church.JUDGE WILSON: 
  You are putting this to him, so I take it you have information to that effect?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I am going to suggest that ...JUDGE WILSON: Suggesting, 
  you are putting it to him that he knew, that is a definite statement isn't it?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Well, I will put that to him, that is the basis on which I am 
  putting it to him. Is that correct, you deny that?MR MKHUMBUZI: What 
  are you talking about?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am saying to you that I believe 
  you knew before the time what the target of the attack was, and that it was 
  a church?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I know nothing about that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  What is your attitude to the fact that it was not only White people in the church? 
  MR MKHUMBUZI: The only thing that I can say is that I sympathise with 
  those who were non-White in the church, I apologise to them, even to the Whites, 
  but they could also understand how was the situation during that time and how 
  quick things could happen, so we couldn't differentiate that these were White 
  and these were Coloureds.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why was it necessary to attack 
  a church?MR MKHUMBUZI: As I've said that I did not know that we were 
  going to attack a church. I didn't know that the target was the church. But 
  I felt as I've said before, the Whites were also using churches to oppress the 
  Blacks. They took our country using churches and Bibles as we are reading the 
  history. We as the oppressed ones.ADV DE JAGER: Do I understand you correct, 
  even if you've known that it was a church, you would have attacked the people 
  in the church?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes.ADV DE JAGER: If it was a church 
  for Black people and there were only Black people, would you have attacked the 
  church then?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, we couldn't have done that.ADV DE JAGER: 
  So you attacked the church and you would have attacked it even if you knew it 
  was a church and there were White people in the church?MR MKHUMBUZI:	
  Can you please come again with the question.ADV DE JAGER: You would have 
  attacked in any event, if you had known it is a church and if you knew beforehand 
  that there was White people in that church?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, we would 
  have continued with the attack. ADV DE JAGER: Yes, now could you give 
  us the reason why you would have continued with the attack, knowing it is a 
  church and knowing there are White people, what was the motivation for your 
  attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: Will you please rephrase your question, I don't 
  understand clearly.ADV DE JAGER: Why did you want to attack the White 
  people?MR MKHUMBUZI: By doing so, attacking the Whites, we knew and we 
  read from the books that they are the ones who took the land from the Africans. 
  That was the main reason for us to attack the Whites.CHAIRMAN: Any further 
  questions?ADV BEMBRIDGE: May I just ask, do you ever go to church yourself, 
  have you ever been to church yourself?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I do go to church.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: So you know that people go there to pray and to pray for peace 
  amongst other things?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I know that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Don't you think that you could have found a better place to attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  As I've said before, I did not know that we were going to the church. Even anywhere 
  the attack would have taken place, not just because it was a church, I mean 
  anywhere the attack was going to take place. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you 
  Mr Chairman.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGECHAIRMAN: Mr Brink?CROSS-EXAMINATION 
  BY MR BRINK: Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman, following on the last aspect 
  of my colleague's questioning to you, are your mother and father still alive?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: My mother is still alive.MR BRINK: And is she a churchgoer 
  to your knowledge?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes.MR BRINK: And while you were 
  still at school, I take it you and your family would go to church on Sundays?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Yes.MR BRINK: To what denomination do you belong?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: The African Gospel Church.MR BRINK: So you must be perfectly 
  aware that a church is a place of sanctuary? MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, the ones 
  I attended I knew that they were sanctuary but there were churches that were 
  used to do the wrong things as I've said before. I've said most of the White 
  churches were used to oppress the Blacks. So the one I attended I knew that 
  people were praying for peace that was not around. Even under the circumstances 
  that they were living, they were praying for peace. So some other churches I 
  knew that they were just being used by our enemies to oppress the Black people.MR 
  BRINK: You have told us that you used to read the newspapers and listen 
  to the radio and presumably watch television, is that correct?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes.MR BRINK: And you must have been aware of the fact that many, many 
  leaders of the so-called White churches were fighting apartheid?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Like whom maybe?MR BRINK: Well, like Beyers Naude of the Dutch Reformed 
  Church. Like Archbishop Tutu of the Anglican Church.MR MKHUMBUZI: I can 
  tell something about Bishop Desmond Tutu, about others I know nothing.MR 
  BRINK: Did you know that he was one of the church leaders who were opposed 
  to apartheid, the answer is yes or the answer is no?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.MR 
  BRINK: You weren't aware of that fact? Are you telling the truth, are you 
  telling the truth here Mr Mkhumbuzi? MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, it is true, I 
  know nothing about that.MR BRINK: You know nothing about Bishop Tutu's 
  activities?MR MKHUMBUZI: I do know about Bishop Desmond Tutu.MR BRINK: 
  Did you know, having regard for the fact that you were a reader and a listener 
  to the radio and a watcher of television, were you or were you not aware, this 
  is the last time that I will ask this question about Bishop Tutu, that he was 
  opposed to apartheid?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I do know that.MR BRINK: 
  Yes. Have you heard of Dr Beyers Naude?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.MR BRINK: 
  You haven't read very much then have you, in the last few years?CHAIRMAN:	
  He is still young.MR BRINK: Anyway, you told us that the church is a 
  place of sanctuary, you agree with that?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, those I used 
  to attend.MR BRINK: All churches are places of sanctuary, aren't they 
  and synagogues and mosques? Are they not? MR MKHUMBUZI: Now I do agree 
  with that, because I can see the role of churches after what happened in this 
  church and I can see that other Priests, when I am watching TV, they do not 
  like violence.JUDGE NGOEPE: Sorry, I think when it was put to the applicant 
  that many White leaders were opposing apartheid, in all fairness to him, it 
  should have likewise been indicated to him that many White church leaders in 
  fact justified apartheid and sought even to justify it on religious grounds.MR 
  BRINK: Yes, that is perfectly true, in fairness to him. I thought that would 
  be dealt with in re-examination. But I take your point, Judge. Yes, you've heard 
  what Judge Ngoepe has said, it is perfectly true that there were some churches 
  in this country who did support apartheid, that is so. But you were also aware 
  of the fact, weren't you that churches provided missionary work to help underprivileged 
  people such as yourself?MR MKHUMBUZI: Are you asking whether I had a 
  knowledge of that?MR BRINK: Yes.MR MKHUMBUZI: Please repeat your 
  question, I did not understand very well.MR BRINK: Were you aware of 
  the fact that many, many churches did missionary work to assist underprivileged 
  people, such as yourself?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I did not know about that 
  and I did not read about that.MR BRINK: Never heard it talked about?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: No.MR BRINK: You only discovered as I understand your 
  evidence, that the target that evening was to be the church at a time when you 
  were approaching it? MR MKHUMBUZI: I did not find that when we were approaching 
  the church, but I only see when we got there, when I saw a board written outside. 
  That was when I noticed that it was a church.MR BRINK: Did you then know 
  that the church was your target?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes.MR BRINK: To 
  your knowledge that church could have been half full of Black people, half full 
  of White people?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, we did not know.MR BRINK: Exactly, 
  you did not know. So you could have been causing injury and death to Black people, 
  had there been Black people in that church that evening?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Is that a question sir?MR BRINK: Yes.MR MKHUMBUZI: Please explain 
  your question again sir.MR BRINK: When you realised that you were going 
  to attack the church, more specifically the people in the church, there could 
  have been many, many Black people at that service as far as you were aware?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: I did not think about that.MR BRINK: You did not think 
  about that. MR MKHUMBUZI: No.MR BRINK: Do I understand then that 
  the attack upon the church was a revenge attack because when the land you say 
  was taken away from your people, they were using the churches, the Whites were 
  using the churches, was this then a revenge attack?MR MKHUMBUZI: It was 
  not a revenge, but we just wanted our land to be brought back to us. Not that 
  we were revenging because churches were used to oppress our people, but we just 
  wanted the land to be brought back to us.MR BRINK: Wasn't this just an 
  act of mindless barbarity?MR MKHUMBUZI: No.MR BRINK: Notwithstanding 
  eleven people were killed and a considerable number of people were seriously 
  injured, defenceless people at prayer?MR MKHUMBUZI: Is that a question 
  sir?MR BRINK: Do you want me to put the question again?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes.MR BRINK: Was this not an act of mindless barbarity, perpetrated 
  on people who were in a house of worship, a house of God at prayer on a Sunday 
  evening, when many people were killed and many, many more seriously injured?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: At that time, we were fighting. According to my understanding 
  every target would be attacked.MR BRINK: So you were fighting and you 
  decided to fight unarmed, defenceless, peaceful people who were at prayer in 
  the house of God? MR MKHUMBUZI: Can you please repeat your question because 
  I don't clearly understand.MR BRINK: No, I don't want to put it again 
  Mr Chairperson. I will read to you a copy of a letter I received from one of 
  the victims in fairness, because the Committee has it and I indicate that this 
  gentleman who is not present, apposes the application. I want to read his letter 
  to you and you may comment on it if you wish. I, Dimitri Makogon, will be out 
  of Cape Town on July the 9th and 10th, 1997 and do wish to make known my opinion 
  regarding the amnesty application by those responsible for the St James massacre 
  in which I lost both legs and my right arm. The aim of the TRC is to establish 
  the truth, the truth is that on July the 25th, 1993, the three applicants killed 
  11 and injured more than 50 civilians, gathered in a church, unarmed and defenceless. 
  Would you like to comment on that?MR MKHUMBUZI: The only thing I would 
  like to say is I don't know when you say he is not in Cape Town, Dimitri ...?MR 
  BRINK: Dimitri Makogon, I don't know whether the pronunciation is correct. 
  He was in church that evening.MR MKHUMBUZI: I really don't know but I 
  would like to meet him and apologise to him. Maybe he would understand because 
  what we did was not right, we do regret that, but I wish we could meet with 
  him, maybe he would like to listen when we try to apologise. But I don't know 
  when you say he is not in Cape Town to show that we are sincerely apologising.NO 
  FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK: Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr Chairman, 
  I have been asked by one of the victims behind me, I have just had a note passed 
  to ask one further question of this applicant if I may be given leave to do 
  that.CHAIRMAN: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: It is actually two questions 
  Mr Chairman. You said that when you went to church, or you say that you didn't 
  go to church and you identified the Uluntu community centre as the place where 
  you went to church, is that correct? MR MKHUMBUZI: No, not at Uluntu 
  community centre, it is African Gospel Church, NY79 in Guguletu.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I beg your pardon, I misunderstood the question. You said you went to a meeting 
  at the Uluntu community centre?MR MKHUMBUZI: When?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You said in your statement you went to a meeting there?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  When, in which meeting?ADV BEMBRIDGE: You said on the Sunday the 25th 
  ...JUDGE WILSON: He didn't say they went to a meeting, he said they met 
  at the Uluntu community centre.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You met Mr Nonxuba at the 
  Uluntu community centre of the 25th of July 1993, is that correct?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes, that is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Was that the blue centre in Khayelitsha, 
  in Site C, next to the railway line?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, the one I am talking 
  about it is in Guguletu, at NY108.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Okay, thank you very 
  much. The second question .... CHAIRMAN: It is not the second one, but 
  I am allowing you. Do carry on.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You say that APLA assumed 
  that St James was in a White group area? Do you yourself know whether that is 
  in fact correct?MR MKHUMBUZI: I am not sure whether it is true or not.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Are you aware that on the time of your attack, Kenilworth was 
  no longer a White group area and that there were people of other races living 
  in Kenilworth?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I didn't know that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you Mr Chairman.JUDGE NGOEPE: But was it a traditionally so-called 
  White area?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I must be honest, as I stated at the outset, 
  it was a question passed to me by one of the victims, I cannot state categorically, 
  but I assume that it was a traditionally White area.CHAIRMAN: Any re-examination?RE-EXAMINATION 
  BY ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman, just shortly. Firstly, I think I 
  made the point in my opening statement, I don't think the applicant mentioned 
  that in his affidavit or in his evidence, about St James being in a White area? 
  Bassie, did you identify St James as a target? The church?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  No, I don't know. I never heard anyone identifying St James as a target, what 
  I knew is that we were going to an operation. ADV ARENDSE: In your opinion, 
  would APLA identify a target which had mostly Black people in it, would you 
  expect them to identify a target like that?MR MKHUMBUZI: No, I don't 
  think so. Such a thing could not have happened. Let me explain. I don't think 
  so because what I have learnt, before anything could happen, we would like to 
  investigate first, so I don't think we will go to places where there is mostly 
  Black people.ADV ARENDSE: Do did you assume that these investigations 
  were done and that the target was as you would have expected it to be, namely 
  White people?CHAIRMAN: He is just going to give you an opinion.ADV 
  ARENDSE: I am asking for his opinion.CHAIRMAN: Yes, you are asking 
  whether he assumed, he assumed that? I don't think it is worth very much.ADV 
  ARENDSE: As you please Mr Chairman, I would withdraw it.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Bassie, were you trained to use R4 rifles and M26 handgrenades, 
  on how to use it?MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, I was trained to use R4 rifles and 
  the handgrenades.ADV ARENDSE: I am just asking you this, because that 
  is the arms and ammunition used during the attack. Now my question is, you were 
  told on your evidence, on a very late stage that you are going to be part of 
  the attack in the form of "security". Now my question is, were you 
  instead of for example Makoma, asked to go inside the church armed with a rifle 
  and a handgrenade? If you had been ordered to do so, would you have done so? 
  MR MKHUMBUZI: Yes, we were working under instructions. I was trained 
  to use the R4 rifle and the handgrenade. If I was instructed to do so, I wouldn't 
  oppose, I would just follow the instructions.ADV ARENDSE: As an APLA 
  operative at the time, why were you not told, informed what the targets would 
  be and who would the target be and so on?MR MKHUMBUZI: The only thing 
  I can say is I was still a new APLA member, I was still in the premature stages 
  under the training. Maybe I am just thinking, if they have told me, they would 
  think I would go and tell the police like to become an informer, sort of, so 
  that I can put my comrades in trouble, because things as such do happen. That 
  is what I am thinking of.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman, I have got 
  no further questions.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSEJUDGE NGOEPE: 
  You are aware, aren't you that there was in some churches, there was apartheid?MR 
  MKHUMBUZI: Yes.JUDGE NGOEPE: And in fact in some churches, they didn't 
  even want Black people to come in to worship in there, isn't that so?MR MKHUMBUZI: 
  Yes, it is so.CHAIRMAN: Yes, thank you very much. Mr Brink, is there 
  any suggestion on your part as to whether we should carry on now?MR BRINK: 
  I don't know how long the, possibly if the next applicant could be led, it would 
  probably take a quarter of an hour to read his statement, to get that out of 
  the way, but I am in your hands. CHAIRMAN: Mr Arendse, get done with 
  his statement. Ms Goza, can we proceed with the statement of the next witness?MS 
  GOZA: Yes, Mr Chairman. For the purposes of the record, I shall now proceed 
  to read the second applicant's statement. "I, the undersigned Thobela Mlambisa, 
  do hereby make oath and say that ..."MS KHAMPEPE: We don't have 
  copies Ms Goza of your affidavit.MS GOZA: We apologise Mr Chairman and 
  members of the Committee, we are quickly trying to make a copy available as 
  soon as possible. We do apologise.CHAIRMAN: You don't have copies there 
  yet?ADV ARENDSE: Sorry Mr Chairman, it is my fault.CHAIRMAN: Yes, 
  you may proceed.MS GOZA: We do apologise, the events of the day are catching 
  up with us.CHAIRMAN: Yes, I understand. It is having its effect elsewhere 
  as well. This will be handed in as Exhibit B.MS GOZA: "I, 
  the undersigned Thobela Mlambisa, do hereby make oath and say that I have already 
  in connection with this application, I wish to make a further affidavit regarding 
  my participation in the St James church incident". Mr Chairman, if at this 
  stage I may indicate that the first portion of that sentence relates to an affidavit 
  that the second applicant made relating to explaining that he had in fact forwarded 
  his application in (indistinct), which at the present moment cannot be found. 
  That is what that first portion of that sentence refers to.JUDGE WILSON: 
  That is still not an application, you say it can't be found. Is there no application 
  then in respect of this applicant?MS GOZA: I beg your pardon My Lord, 
  my colleague is correcting me that it has been found. I do apologise, I was 
  not aware.JUDGE WILSON: I trust that it is going to be made available 
  to us some time.MS GOZA: "Paragraph 2 - The facts to which I depose 
  are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless the context states 
  otherwise. Paragraph 3 - I have been a member of the Pan African Congress, commonly 
  known as the PAC since 1989 and I have been a member of the African People's 
  Liberation Army, commonly known as APLA, since 1990 whilst I was still at school. 
  I was recruited into APLA by Sichomiso Nonxuba, now deceased. Paragraph 4 - 
  I grew up in the Kentani area and went to school there up to standard 10, where 
  I attended the Maqibe High School. I matriculated in 1990. Paragraph 5 - I had 
  been appointed as a unit Commissioner in the Transkei where I was operating 
  from. Paragraph 6 - On the Tuesday before the incident took place, I got an 
  order from the late Mandla, also known as Mazala or Powa, the APLA Chief of 
  Logistics in the Eastern Cape Region to come to Cape Town. I had never before 
  been to Cape Town. He gave me an address where to go to. I knew that I was coming 
  to Cape Town on an APLA mission. At the time, I did not know it was going to 
  be the St James church. I left Umtata on a Chilwan's bus, on the Wednesday and 
  arrived in Cape Town on Thursday. I went to an address in Macassar and found 
  Sichomiso Nonxuba and Makoma there. Nonxuba told me that my code name was Aubrey 
  and introduced me to Makoma as Aubrey. I knew Nonxuba, but I was meeting Makoma 
  for the first time. Nonxuba told me that I had been requested to come to Cape 
  Town so that I could act as the driver during the operation. At that stage he 
  gave no details. Nonxuba and Makoma left me at this house in Macassar and returned 
  later that night. They still did not tell me what the operation was about. Paragraph 
  7 - On the Saturday before the Sunday when the incident took place, I met Nonxuba 
  and Mkhumbuzi at the Iona shopping centre in Guguletu at approximately three 
  o'clock. There I was introduced to Bassie. Nonxuba again told me that I would 
  be driving during the operation the following day, but gave me no details. My 
  task was to hijack a car. I then went back to the house in Macassar. The next 
  day Makoma fetched me with a taxi and we went to the Uluntu community centre 
  in Guguletu where we met Nonxuba and Bassie. Nonxuba spoke as the Commander 
  and said that we would be involved in an operation that day but he never mentioned 
  what the target was going to be and when it was going to take place. However, 
  he told me and Makoma that we were to get a car. We had to meet him at the Langa 
  taxi rank at 6 pm, that evening. Makoma and I then went to Guguletu where we 
  saw a Datsun motor vehicle, idling in the road. The driver came out of the house 
  and I approached him and asked him whether we could borrow the car and that 
  we would return it. We told him that we were members of the PAC and APLA. He 
  refused and I shot at him with my 9 mm pistol. I don't know whether I shot him 
  because I only wanted to frighten him. He then surrendered the car and I drove 
  it. Paragraph 8 - I then drove to the Langa taxi rank where we met Nonxuba and 
  Mkhumbuzi. They got into the car. Nonxuba then directed me as I drove. When 
  we got to the target and after we had circled the building a few times, I noticed 
  that it was a church. Paragraph 9 - I pulled the car to the front of the church, 
  with the back facing the entrance. While the car was idling, Makoma and Nonxuba 
  got out and Bassie and I stayed inside the car. While we were waiting, a red 
  car stopped, blocking our exit. Bassie then threw a molatov cocktail at the 
  car and I shot one round at the car, causing the car to speed away. More-or-less 
  at this time, Makoma and Nonxuba came out of the church. I had heard a grenade 
  exploding and I heard firing inside the church. I knew that people were going 
  to get killed or injured during the operation. Paragraph 10 - I drove off under 
  instructions from Nonxuba who was the Commander of the operation. I dropped 
  Nonxuba and Makoma at a house in Ottery and Bassie and I then went to a nearby 
  scrapyard, to leave the car there. The scrapyard was about two kilometres away. 
  We returned to the house on foot and stayed there until the next morning. Later 
  that Sunday night, we saw on the CNN news what happened inside the church. The 
  next morning I left the house with Makoma and went to Crossroads in a taxi. 
  From Crossroads, I took the taxi to Macassar. This is the last time that I saw 
  those guys. I went back to Old Crossroads from Macassar during the week, and 
  stayed there for about a week until I heard that Makoma had been arrested. I 
  then left Cape Town for the Transkei with a taxi. Paragraph 12 - I was arrested 
  on the 25th of January 1996 in Tempe, Bloemfontein, while I was being integrated 
  into the South African National Defence Force. At the time I was at the First 
  Special Service Battalion. I am currently stationed at 97 Ammunition Depot in 
  De Aar. Paragraph 13 - I deeply regret causing the loss of life on the 25th 
  of July 1993 and further causing so many people to be injured and maimed. I 
  wish to ask the relatives and friends of the deceased and those who were victims 
  of the attack, to forgive me. At the time I was acting under instructions from 
  APLA High Command and I was trained not to question these instructions. Paragraph 
  14 - I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements 
  of the Act, that the offences in respect of which I am applying for amnesty 
  are offences associated with a political objective, committed in the course 
  of the conflicts of the past and which are in accordance with the provisions 
  of Section 20, subsection 2 and subsection 3 of the Act and that I have made 
  a full disclosure of all the relevant facts. Accordingly I respectfully request 
  that the Committee grant me amnesty". Mr Chairman, those are the contents 
  of the second applicant's sworn statement.CHAIRMAN: Mr Mlambisa, will 
  you just stand please. Sisi, swear him in.THOBELA MLAMBISA: (sworn states)MS 
  KHAMPEPE: Thank you, you have been properly sworn in.CHAIRMAN: Have 
  you understood your affidavit which has been read out by your counsel?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes, I did.CHAIRMAN: And do you agree that that is the 
  truth? And do you confirm its contents?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, I do.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes, thank you.ADV DE JAGER: Before we adjourn, I don't know what is 
  contained in the other affidavit or in the application, because it is not before 
  us, but in this affidavit as far as I could gather, it is not clear what the 
  political objective was. I don't know whether it is, perhaps you could point 
  out where it is mentioned.MS GOZA: If we could be granted a short time 
  to ... Advocate De Jager, the paragraph 3 of the second applicant's affidavit 
  states that the applicant was a member of APLA and the affidavit on paragraph 
  6 goes on to state out the instructions that were given to the applicant from 
  APLA High Command. And on paragraph 13, it is specifically stated there, and 
  if I may read from paragraph 13, "At the time I was acting under instructions 
  for APLA High Command and I was trained not to question these instructions".	
  We would respectfully submit that those paragraphs read together state the objectives 
  as is required in Section 20 of the Act.ADV DE JAGER: I think it states 
  that he received instructions from APLA and that he carried out instructions 
  from APLA, but nowhere is it stated that the objective for the act associated 
  with a political objective, that the objective might have been to gain political 
  power or whatever it might be, but you could have a look at it tonight and see 
  whether you are satisfied.CHAIRMAN: And you can adduce evidence to that 
  effect?MS GOZA: We are indebted to the Chairperson and Mr De Jager, we 
  will look into the option of actually then leading oral evidence in relation 
  to that particular aspect.CHAIRMAN: Very well, we will now adjourn and 
  resume at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.COMMISSION ADJOURNSON RESUMPTION 
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink, are we ready to proceed?MR BRINK: I just want 
  to - yes Mr Chairman, but before the matter proceeds, I understand the Committee 
  now has copies of the application of Mr Thobela Mlambisa.CHAIRMAN: Yes.MR 
  BRINK: The mystery of Mr Letlapa Mphlalele appears to have been cleared 
  up. There was a news item in this morning's Cape Times on page 3 on the bottom 
  left hand corner, and I will read it. "Former APLA Operations Director 
  Letlapa Mphlalele was a guest of the PAC and could not be released to appear 
  at the TRC's amnesty hearing in Cape Town yesterday in protest against the TRC's 
  lack of objectivity, the PAC Transkei branch said last night. Mphlalele failed 
  to appear as scheduled yesterday with Bassie Mkhumbuzi, Thobela Mlambisa and 
  Gcinikhaya Makoma to apply for amnesty in connection with the St James church 
  massacre in 1993. The Transkei branch said discussions should be held first 
  with the PAC national leaders about the uneven-handedness in which political 
  parties, previously involved in the political conflict, are being treated by 
  the TRC functionaries." That was a South African Press Association release.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes, thank you. In the light of that statement, it is after all only a press 
  statement, it is not an official communication.MR BRINK: No.CHAIRMAN: 
  Directed at the TRC or directed to the Amnesty Committee.MR BRINK: No, 
  but I thought I would bring it to your attention Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes. I would imagine that in due course there would be some official communication 
  from the PAC at their leadership level directed, sent to us about their attitude.MR 
  BRINK: Yes.CHAIRMAN: We will then know whether Mr Mphlalele is going 
  to pursue his application or not. Is there any light you can throw on that?MR 
  BRINK: No, not at all. CHAIRMAN: Ms Goza?MS GOZA: Not at all.CHAIRMAN:	
  Yes. Mr Arendse, no? Thank you very much.JUDGE WILSON: Should we re-number 
  this B1 and number the new affidavit B2?CHAIRMAN: Yes. 
  We will renumber the two affidavits. The affidavit of Mr Mlambisa, the first 
  one should be B1 and the one that has just been handed in, should be 
  B2.MS GOZA: Mr Chairperson and members of the Committee, before 
  the proceedings proceed in the line of questions, could I be permitted to re-examine 
  the second applicant, Mr Mlambisa in relation to the aspect that was raised 
  by Adv De Jager concerning the political objective? It was raised yesterday 
  Mr Chairperson.CHAIRMAN: Yes, you may do so.MS GOZA: Thank you. 
  CHAIRMAN: Just remind him he is under oath.MS KHAMPEPE: May I 
  just interject, Ms Goza, to remind Mr Mlambisa that he is still under oath.THOBELA 
  MLAMBISA: (still under oath) EXAMINATION BY MS GOZA: Mr Mlambisa, 
  you are a member of APLA, are you?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, that is correct.MS 
  GOZA: What are the objectives of APLA? Mr Mlambisa, I am speaking to you 
  in English, there is an interpretation for you. If you feel more comfortable, 
  please feel free to talk in your vernacular. Can we start again. MR MLAMBISA: 
  APLA was the armed wing of PAC. It was formed to overthrow the White government 
  because the European Whites took our land from our people.MS GOZA: Do 
  you associate yourself with the objectives of APLA?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, 
  I do.MS GOZA: If you associate yourself with the objectives of APLA, 
  how do you understand your involvement in the St James incident?MR MLAMBISA: 
  APLA had its own Commanders. I am involved in the St James massacre because 
  I took orders from my Commander. I felt happy in that operation, the St James 
  operation.MS GOZA: Can you please explain what you mean when you say 
  that you were happy?MR MLAMBISA: To explain that we were working under 
  orders of our Commanders. It was an operation that will liberate Africans, so 
  that we can be in democracy. MS GOZA: Now that you know that so many 
  people were killed in that incident, how do you feel?MR MLAMBISA: Now 
  I feel very bad and I would like the people who were in the church, today to 
  forgive us because at the time we were fighting.MS GOZA: Thank you Mr 
  Chairman.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS GOZACROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Mlambisa, when did you start training with APLA?MR 
  MLAMBISA: In 1990.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And what form did your training 
  take?MR MLAMBISA: Military training.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And what did 
  you learn in that military training?MR MLAMBISA: How?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How to do what?MR MLAMBISA: There are many things done in the Army. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Were you trained in the use of weapons?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, 
  that is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were you trained in how to plan attacks?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes, we were trained for that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were you trained 
  that it was important to plan attacks and that all attacks should be well planned?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes, that is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I see in the attack 
  on the St James church, you were instructed to be the driver of the vehicle 
  that would be used? Was there any specific reason why you were chosen as the 
  driver?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, there was a reason.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What 
  was that reason?MR MLAMBISA: The unit on this attack had no driver, they 
  decided to take me to be their driver.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Had you had special 
  training in driving?MR MLAMBISA: No. ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did you 
  know that the unit in Cape Town had no driver?MR MLAMBISA: I got this 
  information when I met the Commander of the operation, the late Mr Commissioner.CHAIRMAN: 
  I think part of the question really is why did they specifically have to go 
  all the way, wasn't he in Umtata?ADV BEMBRIDGE: In Umtata.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes, why did they have to go all the way to Umtata from Cape Town specifically 
  to come and take you as a driver?MR MLAMBISA: I wouldn't know that, because 
  I was just following orders from my Commanders. The reason for that, I am not 
  aware of it.JUDGE WILSON: Could you give us the name of the person again, 
  I am afraid I didn't get it, from the late, who was it?MR MLAMBISA: Which 
  one, because there are two people who are deceased?JUDGE WILSON: Well 
  you said you got information that there was no driver from the late somebody.MR 
  MLAMBISA: Please repeat your question sir.JUDGE WILSON: Did anybody 
  make a note of it, can somebody else tell me what the name was?MS KHAMPEPE: 
  Sichomiso Nonxuba. JUDGE WILSON: Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I take 
  it that it was also part of your training that when an attack was to be planned, 
  one should go and have a look at the place where the attack would take place 
  and plan the attack properly as to how it would happen there?MR MLAMBISA: 
  It is not so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why is that not so? Is that not part of proper 
  planning?MR MLAMBISA: I was not a Commander of APLA at the time.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I think you are misunderstanding my question, I am not saying 
  did you go and plan the attack, what I am saying were you not trained during 
  your training that if one is to command an attack, it is important to go and 
  have a look first at the place where the attack will take place, so that you 
  can plan how it will happen there?MS KHAMPEPE: Mr Bembridge, can I also 
  understand your question. Are you saying if one has to command an attack or 
  participate in an attack?CHAIRMAN: If one has to plan.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  My question perhaps should be rephrased, that is an important part of planning 
  an attack that the site of the attack would be visited to ascertain how the 
  attack will take place there? In the ordinary course that that would be a normal 
  part of the training?CHAIRMAN: Yes, carry on.MR MLAMBISA: I don't 
  clearly understand the question.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Okay, what I am asking 
  you is was it part of your training, did they teach you in training that when 
  an attack is planned, it is an important part of that planning to go and look 
  at the place where the attack will happen to plan how the attack will take place 
  there? MR MLAMBISA: I was not trained in that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You 
  said you were told that it was important to plan attacks. How then was this 
  planning going to take place, how did they tell you that you were to plan attacks?JUDGE 
  WILSON: Were you taught at all how to plan attacks or were you merely taught 
  how to carry out orders?MR MLAMBISA: The Commanders would come to the 
  units on the ground and they would give us the sketch and they would give us 
  instructions to follow. That is how we were trained.JUDGE NGOEPE: Sorry, 
  what sketch are you talking about, would that be the sketch of the intended 
  object of an attack?MR MLAMBISA: No, it was not about the sketch of the 
  attack, it was the way of an operation. Even after the liberation, we were taught 
  how to protect our country from another country, if the country is to attack 
  South Africa again.JUDGE NGOEPE: It may be that you were not specifically 
  trained or told in training that some planning must take place, but you are 
  a trained soldier of APLA, wouldn't you expect some surveillance to take place 
  first and some planning? Not necessarily by yourself, by somebody else given 
  your military knowledge and training?MR MLAMBISA: Things like what?JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Wouldn't you expect that prior to an attack and as part of training, 
  there will be some surveillance etc, planning, visiting the place and so on?CHAIRMAN: 
  To identify that target, to see where it is situated, how best to approach it, 
  matters of that kind? MR MLAMBISA: As far as I know, it was happening 
  in the ranks of APLA, but I for one, I have never done that.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes, you can't take that any further.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. 
  Now, are you aware whether any such planning took place regarding this particular 
  attack on the St James church?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, I think so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Do you know who did that planning?MR MLAMBISA: No, I don't know. I think 
  it was my Commander.ADV BEMBRIDGE: That was Mr Nonxuba?MR MLAMBISA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did he give you any instructions as to how to carry 
  out this attack?MR MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did he then 
  expect you to know what you were supposed to do?MR MLAMBISA: I won't 
  know. ADV BEMBRIDGE: So are you saying that you would go to the attack 
  with the Commander, but you wouldn't know what to do when you got there?MR 
  MLAMBISA: We knew that on our way to St James, on that Sunday.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  What did he tell you on the way to St James?MR MLAMBISA: He just directed 
  me as a driver, he was just giving me directions how to drive and where to go 
  up until we reached the St James church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He didn't tell 
  you what you were going to do when you got there? Do you know?MR MLAMBISA:	
  Do you mean us?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Yes.MR MLAMBISA: He told me on Sunday 
  when we met at Uluntu community centre that I will be helping them by driving 
  the car during their operation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What did he tell you was 
  the nature of the operation?MR MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He 
  didn't tell you where you would be driving the car to?MR MLAMBISA: No. 
  ADV BEMBRIDGE: He didn't tell you where you would be going afterwards?MR 
  MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: He also didn't tell you what the target 
  of the attack was?MR MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Nobody else told 
  you, none of your other comrades who were participating in the attack told you 
  what the target of the attack was?MR MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And you were the driver of the vehicle who would take the people to the attack 
  and take them away from the attack, that is correct is it not?MR MLAMBISA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you have any plans as to what you would do if 
  anything went wrong?MR MLAMBISA: No, we had no plans.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  So, if I am understanding you correctly then, you were the person responsible 
  for making sure that the team got to the attack and away from the attack safely, 
  but you had no idea of where you were going or how to get away from there thereafter?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Can you please repeat what you have just said? ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I am saying is it correct to say ...CHAIRMAN: Your question is really 
  a repetition of what you have been asking, you know. All he knew is that he 
  was going to drive this group to that place and drive them back.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Mr Mlambisa, what would have happened if something had gone wrong? You didn't 
  know what the target was, what if it had been a military target and Nonxuba 
  had been shot, how would you have escaped?MR MLAMBISA: If I can tell 
  you correctly, I think the people who are sitting next to me, would have directed 
  me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But they also say they had no idea where the target 
  was or what it was going to be.MR MLAMBISA: Yes, it is like that, they 
  didn't know where we were going to attack, but they are residing in Cape Town, 
  they know Kenilworth and they know Wynberg. They know Cape Town as a whole.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: But you were chosen as the driver?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, I 
  was chosen.JUDGE WILSON: Did you say in your evidence yesterday, that 
  this was the first time you've been to Cape Town?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I think that is in fact contained in the statement in hand. When 
  you went to steal the car that you were going to use in the attack, once you 
  had stolen it, what if any preparations did you make to actually use it in the 
  attack? JUDGE NGOEPE: Such as?ADV BEMBRIDGE: For example, did 
  you put petrol in the car?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, we did put petrol in the 
  car.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Am I correct in saying that you put about R40-00 worth 
  of petrol in the car?MR MLAMBISA: Are you telling me that?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I am asking you if that is about right or not?MR MLAMBISA: No, I can't 
  remember, I think it was R50-00. I think it was R50-00.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  How did you know that would be enough?MR MLAMBISA: I don't know whether 
  there was no petrol in the car, but we thought it was not enough and we were 
  just preparing for an emergency, so we had to put petrol in the car.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  If you were preparing for an emergency, why didn't you ask your Commander what 
  the possible escape route was or what plans he had in case something went wrong?MR 
  MLAMBISA: I cannot know, only my Commander can know that because he was 
  the one who gave us the petrol money, he was the one who knew how was the operation 
  going to take place, otherwise I know nothing further than that.ADV DE JAGER:	
  Mr Bembridge, isn't the crux of the matter the admitting they had done this, 
  they admit this brutal shooting, that he drove the car, that he in fact robbed 
  the car, that he shot somebody in robbing the car. Isn't the crux of the matter 
  the question of proportionality? ADV BEMBRIDGE: With respect, Mr De Jager, 
  I think there are two issues to this. The one is the issue of proportionality, 
  the other one is the issue of full disclosure and we dispute that a full disclosure 
  is being made here. I do not accept that these applicants are being honest in 
  purporting to dissociate themselves with any responsibility for the choice of 
  target or denying that they had any knowledge of the type of target that they 
  were going to attack. I submit that is not in the spirit of the disclosure that 
  is contemplated in the Act.CHAIRMAN: Well, full disclosure certainly 
  of relevant facts, but whether R40-00 or R50-00 worth of petrol was put in the 
  car, who put the petrol and matters of that kind, surely I don't think that 
  we should go into detail of that kind, I don't think they impinge on the point 
  that you are trying to make.ADV BEMBRIDGE: As you please Mr Chairman.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: I understand you to, in effect, it may be a question of how one 
  does it, but I understand you to say that, listening to your previous five questions 
  or so, I understand you to want to show that these applicants took part actually 
  even in the planning of this operation and possibly they are just putting everything 
  onto the late Nonxuba or something like that and that they must have taken part 
  in the actual planning and sat down and discussed what we must do, which route 
  to take if we are caught, something like that. I think that is what you are 
  trying to do and you are saying that by trying to say that they did not take 
  part in the planning and the like, they are withholding information?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  That is my suggestion. I will submit it is essential in the nature of an operation 
  such as this, that everyone would have had to have some input in as to how the 
  attack was to take place. Specifically the driver, who would be responsible 
  for the safety of the team to a large extent.JUDGE NGOEPE: And maybe 
  agree or even disagree on certain aspects of the planning, something like that.JUDGE 
  WILSON: Do you dispute that this was his first visit to Cape Town, you haven't 
  asked a thing about that? If it was his first visit to Cape Town, is it at all 
  likely that he would know what route to take, what to do, wouldn't he have to 
  rely on the people who lived in Cape Town to tell him that?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  I am unfortunately not in a position to dispute that was his first trip to Cape 
  Town, but to the extent that he alleges that that is a significant factor in 
  that it mitigates against the suggestion that there is any likelihood that this 
  attack being carried out without him having been fully appraised as to how it 
  would be done, where the attack was to take place, what the target was and how 
  it was intended he would escape.JUDGE WILSON: Are you suggesting they 
  drove him around Cape Town, showing him the roads in Cape Town? Which routes 
  he could take, because I find that very hard to believe? ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I am suggesting ...JUDGE WILSON: He was a common soldier, he was not 
  an officer of APLA, he was brought in for one purpose and that was to drive 
  the vehicle, so he says. There were three other people in the vehicle with him, 
  all from Cape Town, surely they are the ones who would have known the route 
  where to go?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I won't take that any further.CHAIRMAN: 
  While you are looking at something else, can we take this further. You asked 
  him what preparations they did in regard to the vehicle and then he mentioned 
  only the petrol, but I am interested in other aspects as well. What further 
  preparations did you make with regard to the vehicle, for example did you remove 
  the original registration numbers of the vehicle, put false ones on or did you 
  drive the vehicle without the registration number?MR MLAMBISA: We drove, 
  we used the car as it was, we only just put in the petrol.ADV DE JAGER: 
  At what time did you steal this car?MR MLAMBISA: It was in the afternoon, 
  round about six o'clock, I am not exactly sure about the time. It was past six 
  or before six o'clock.ADV DE JAGER: Because you had to meet your colleagues 
  at six o'clock. So you had to get the car before six o'clock if possible?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes. That is why I am saying I am not sure about the time. But 
  what I am sure of, after six o'clock we were already in Langa from where we 
  had taken the car.ADV DE JAGER: And before taking the car, you were armed 
  already? MR MLAMBISA: Yes, we were already armed.ADV DE JAGER:	
  And in fact you shot at the owner of the car?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.ADV 
  DE JAGER: Did you hit him?MR MLAMBISA: I am not sure whether I did 
  hit him or not.ADV DE JAGER: Did you intend to hit him?MR MLAMBISA:	
  No, no.ADV DE JAGER: But if it was only a shot fired, I am sure you would 
  have been able to tell us no, I didn't intend to hit him and I didn't hit him 
  because I didn't shoot at him, I only wanted to frighten him.MR MLAMBISA:	
  I just wanted to frighten him so that he can give us the car keys and we take 
  the car.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You say that the first time that you realised 
  you were attacking the church, was when you had already circled the church a 
  number of times. What did you think when you realised that it was a church that 
  you were going to attack?MR MLAMBISA: There was nothing I could do, I 
  was just following orders from my Commander. I had to obey orders.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Why do you have to obey orders, why is there a reason why you cannot say I do 
  not want to participate in this attack? MR MLAMBISA: I would have been 
  putting myself into trouble, we were not trained that way.CHAIRMAN: And 
  in fact you wanted to obey orders, that is the position, isn't it? You wanted 
  to be part of the process?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  When was the first time you met Mr Nonxuba?MR MLAMBISA: I met him in 
  Transkei.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And how did you meet him at that time, how did 
  that meeting come about?MR MLAMBISA: He was my trainer and my Commander. 
  It is him who recruited me to join the APLA.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When did he 
  come to stay in Cape Town, do you know?MR MLAMBISA: He stayed here a 
  very long time, I think he grew up here in Cape Town.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were 
  you aware of the type of weapons that were going to be used in the attack?MR 
  MLAMBISA: No, I had no idea.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You say though that you 
  were armed before the attack took place? MR MLAMBISA: Not for the attack, 
  but I had a pistol for myself.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where did you get it from?MR 
  MLAMBISA: I got it from Khaya Makoma.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Okay, do you 
  know where he got it from?MR MLAMBISA: I am sorry, I don't know.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Where were you when he gave it to you?MR MLAMBISA: I was 
  in Macassar. I was in a house in Macassar.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you know 
  whose house that is?MR MLAMBISA: No, I don't know, but when I came there 
  they were the only people who were there and I was the one who was staying there.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Did you ever meet the person called Vusi?MR MLAMBISA: 
  No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Have you ever heard of him? MR MLAMBISA: No.CHAIRMAN: 
  Did Makoma tell you why he gave you the pistol, what did he give it for?MR 
  MLAMBISA: I think it is because as I was coming in there, I was introduced 
  by Sichomiso Nonxuba to him and he introduced myself to Sichomiso and he told 
  them that I was also a member of APLA. So, I think for my own protection I got 
  that pistol.CHAIRMAN: Protection against what?MR MLAMBISA: From 
  our enemies because APLA was well-known that it was fighting, the Boers were 
  fighting the PAC.CHAIRMAN: He didn't tell you that you need it to have 
  it in the light of the mission that was to be carried out?MR MLAMBISA: 
  No, I was just given it for my own security reasons.CHAIRMAN: Thank you.JUDGE 
  WILSON: Who is Mazala or Powa?MR MLAMBISA: Mazala is the Chief of 
  Logistics in the Eastern Cape Region.JUDGE WILSON: And what did he have 
  to do with this mission? MR MLAMBISA: It is very difficult to understand 
  the opinions of the High Command and their duties because APLA has its own top 
  secrets.CHAIRMAN: Carry on.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you ask Makoma anything 
  about the attack?MR MLAMBISA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why not?MR 
  MLAMBISA: I knew from Transkei that there was going to be an operation, 
  otherwise I didn't know it in detail. I knew that there was going to be an operation 
  whether of which kind, but I had no guts to ask. That is what I knew it from 
  my heart. An operation for PAC.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was your motive for 
  taking part in the attack?MR MLAMBISA: I also wanted to be the part of 
  those who were going to free the Azania.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did you think 
  this attack would contribute towards freeing Azania?MR MLAMBISA: The 
  government would have noticed that the African want their land back and along 
  the line, they would have given us freedom as we can see at the present moment, 
  we do have democracy.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is that democracy not rather as a 
  result of the negotiations that took place between all the political parties? 
  MR MLAMBISA: I won't know that. Maybe negotiations took part, but the 
  only thing I know, it was a pressure from the APLA movements.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How did you think this attack would make the White people give your land back?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Like now, we are free. We can come forward and tell the truth, 
  we are not radicals any more, we are the peace loving people.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How did the attack contribute to that though?MR MLAMBISA: Because democracy.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: How did the attack lead to democracy?MR MLAMBISA: It was 
  a pressure to the government by the APLA. The government noticed that their 
  people are dying, so they must do something.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When you say 
  that the government noticed that their people are dying, what people are you 
  referring to?MR MLAMBISA: Those who oppressed us.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  The White people?MR MLAMBISA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: If you look at 
  the people sitting in the two rows behind me, they are all people who were part 
  of that congregation at St James that you attacked, do you not see many people 
  there who are not White people? MR MLAMBISA: I can see them.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How would it assist you to attack them at St James?MR MLAMBISA: As I've 
  said before, that I was taking orders from my Commander. And if you are just 
  shooting, if you are just shooting someone within many people, you just get 
  shot to everyone. That was the policy of the APLA.CHAIRMAN: I didn't 
  get that clearly, maybe it wasn't translated or interpreted, just say that again 
  please. The last part of your sentence, if you just shoot, what did you say?MR 
  MLAMBISA: If you are in a place where there are Boers mostly, because APLA 
  was attacking the suburbs, which means the White areas, we exactly knew that 
  in suburbs the residents were White, so the churches that were there, were attended 
  by White people, because Blacks were not going to the White churches. So if 
  there were a few Black people in there and the majority was White, then there 
  was no reason for us not to attack.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Would you say it is 
  APLA policy to attack a church where nearly half the people are not White?MR 
  MLAMBISA: APLA was attacking the Boers.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And if nearly 
  half of the people who were there in the church, were not Boers, what then?MR 
  MLAMBISA: As far as I know, the methods of the High Command, they do recognisance 
  whereby they would have decided whether the target must be attacked by APLA. 
  It was obvious by the time we were going to St James, they knew that there were 
  only Whites there or mostly Whites. ADV BEMBRIDGE: It is interesting 
  that you say that, because the people from St James will say that they think, 
  they read that they noticed the church being reconnoitred prior to the attack 
  taking place. So they agree with you that it is probably so that the attack 
  was planned and whoever the planner was, knew what type of people would be in 
  the church.MR MLAMBISA: It is obvious the one who was planning the attack, 
  was our Commander and he knew that there were only Whites there.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Well, clearly he didn't know that, because there were not only Whites there. 
  And if that is the case, do you still say that it is in accordance with APLA 
  policy to have attacked that church?MR MLAMBISA: It is only him who can 
  answer that, Sichomiso. I for one, I knew that reconnaissance was being done 
  by the Commanders. We were only just taking orders from our Commander.JUDGE 
  WILSON: When you arrived at the church, you parked right outside the front 
  of it, is that so?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.JUDGE WILSON: I read in 
  the newspaper yesterday evening I think, that there were an estimated 900 people 
  in the church. If this was so, this would have probably meant there were a lot 
  of cars parked outside that church. Did you notice that?MR MLAMBISA: 
  Yes, I have noticed that.JUDGE WILSON: That there were a lot of cars?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.JUDGE WILSON: So it would seem that there would 
  be lots of people there apart from those who lived in the immediate vicinity? 
  People who had gone there by car?MR MLAMBISA: Yes. JUDGE WILSON: 
  Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What about the foreign people that were in the 
  church, the people from Russia who were in the church, how would it assist for 
  APLA to attack them?MR MLAMBISA: I didn't know about that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  The person, the people from St James will say that they had for almost two years, 
  when Russian people coming to that church every weekend and that whoever therefore, 
  did the reconnaissance would have known that.MR MLAMBISA: What was I 
  supposed to do then?CHAIRMAN: He has already told you he was merely the 
  driver and he did (indistinct), as to whether they were Russians or not would 
  hardly be something within his knowledge.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr Mlambisa, 
  do you still say - or how many people was it that went into the church, only 
  two?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, sir.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Are you sure of that?MR 
  MLAMBISA: As I've said, I am definitely sure.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Because 
  Mr Smith, Mr Lorenzo Smith will say that he thinks he saw three people in the 
  church.MR MLAMBISA: He does not know the truth. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  There was a car that came and stopped in front of you while you were standing 
  in the parking lot, is that so?MR MLAMBISA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  And the person who was in the car with you, threw a petrol bomb at that car 
  and you shot at that car. Why was that, why did you do that?MR MLAMBISA: 
  I didn't throw a petrol bomb, I just shot at it because it was parking in front 
  of us, so we didn't have a way to go out.ADV BEMBRIDGE: That petrol bomb 
  and that bullet could have killed the person in that car, isn't it so?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Just because that person was a White, I just wanted to hit that 
  person, but unfortunately it didn't.ADV BEMBRIDGE: So you didn't really 
  care who was killed in the course of this attack, you were prepared to kill 
  anyone who got in your way?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, it is true.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You also didn't know for a fact that the person in that car was a White person, 
  did you?MR MLAMBISA: It was clear that it was a White person.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How was it clear, it was dark wasn't it?MR MLAMBISA: There was a light, 
  there was a bright light in St James, so I noticed that the person was White. 
  ADV BEMBRIDGE: Have you ever been to church Mr Mlambisa?MR MLAMBISA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you still go to church?MR MLAMBISA: Yes, 
  I am still going to church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you not think it was wrong 
  to attack people in a church where they are praying?MR MLAMBISA: I had 
  nothing to do then, because I was just taking orders from my Commander.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Can you explain why the PAC has condemned your attack on the 
  church as being wrong, why they did so at that time?MR MLAMBISA: I am 
  sorry, I cannot explain that, I am also confused.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What 
  are you confused about?MR MLAMBISA: About the condemning of the mission 
  that took place in St James.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And why was it, or do you 
  know why it was that APLA themselves denied that they had any responsibility 
  for the attack?MR MLAMBISA: APLA never denied that.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Perhaps I can read something to you from a report in the Argus on the 26th of 
  July 1993 where it was reported ...ADV DE JAGER: Page?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  It is page 36 of the bundle, I beg your pardon, of the second bundle that was 
  handed up by the victims yesterday.ADV DE JAGER: thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  It is a report in the Argus that says APLA denies involvement in massacre. The 
  Azanian People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the Pan Africanist Congress 
  said the massacre at St James church was not our sort of operation. Can you 
  explain why they would say it is not their sort of operation?MR MLAMBISA: 
  APLA has its own Commanders. Can you tell me who said that?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  It was said from Dar Es Salaam.JUDGE WILSON: Shouldn't you read that 
  next paragraph as well. Commenting from Dar Es Salaam today an APLA spokesman 
  said the movement was still waiting for information from its forces on the ground, 
  and that they would issue a full statement later?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I was 
  going to move on to that Judge. Would you like to respond to that?MR MLAMBISA:	
  Yes, you can carry on. ADV BEMBRIDGE: The second paragraph that the Judge 
  read to you, did you understand that? MR MLAMBISA: No, I didn't understand. 
  I thought he was just referring to you.CHAIRMAN: I think in fairness, 
  this witness may never have seen this article at all. I think it should be placed 
  before him to see it.ADV BEMBRIDGE: We can do that. ADV ARENDSE: 
  He clearly doesn't read the Argus ...MR MLAMBISA: Where about?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: The article is headed "APLA denies involvement in massacre."MS 
  KHAMPEPE: Mr Bembridge, can you just read it out so that it can be interpreted 
  to him, maybe it will facilitate matters.ADV BEMBRIDGE: The section the 
  Judge referred to was commenting from Dar Es Salaam today an APLA spokesman 
  said that the movement was still waiting ...MR MLAMBISA: If the one who 
  is interpreting can speak in English, maybe I would understand.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  I will read it for you again. It says commenting from Dar Es Salaam today an 
  APLA spokesman said the movement was still waiting for information from its 
  forces on the ground, but we don't believe every killing in South Africa can 
  be attributed to APLA, though APLA would issue a full statement later. He said 
  last night's attack was not the sort of operation APLA would mount."MR 
  MLAMBISA: Would you like me to answer?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you have 
  any comment on that? MR MLAMBISA: Yes, I do.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What 
  is your comment?MR MLAMBISA: The PAC has got its own movement. I would 
  like to know the person who wrote this. The Boers can also write this. I would 
  like the person who wrote this report, this spokesman, if I am talking about 
  the spokesman, they are not talking about any one, I would like the name of 
  that person. Maybe Mphlalele, I just want the name of that person. APLA did 
  not deny their involvement in this operation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You said 
  that your instructions came from APLA High Command, is that not right?MR 
  MLAMBISA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is it not rather the case that this 
  was an attack planned not by the High Command, but by someone in Cape Town who 
  was not authorised in any way to carry out an attack of this nature?MR MLAMBISA: 
  I think it was the members of the High Command. The well-known Pepe Mphlalele 
  approved what we did in St James.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But he is not here today 
  to confirm that he approved of it, he decided not to come.MR MLAMBISA: 
  I am not saying that, I am just saying in the operation plan, I know nothing 
  about Letlapa, I am just referring to the operation question about the approval 
  of it.INTERPRETER: The speaker's microphone is not on.ADV DE JAGER: 
  In the same bundle you have presented to us the very next page, page 37, there 
  is an article headed various organisations claim responsibility for the attack. 
  According to a spokesperson of the South African Press Association, SAPA, a 
  man phoned the agency on Monday morning in Cape Town and introduced himself 
  as the Regional Commander of APLA. He apparently said that more blood would 
  be shed if the country was not returned to the Blacks. And then it continues 
  to say that the PAC in fact the Regional Director, denied that APLA was involved.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Firstly I would submit that it is clear that the PAC at all times 
  have denied participating and condemned the attack and secondly that lends some 
  support I would submit to the suggestion that this was an attack planned by 
  a local Commander perhaps without authority, rather than an attack planned by 
  High Command as is suggested.ADV DE JAGER: Yes. Well, while you suggested 
  that, what would the position then be as far as soldiers are concerned, if it 
  was in fact planned by a local Commander who had authority or would you suggest 
  he had no authority over the foot soldiers?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, clearly 
  he wouldn't have authority to authorise attacks which were not in accordance 
  with PAC and APLA policy at the time.ADV DE JAGER: But how would that 
  impact on the foot soldier?ADV BEMBRIDGE: To the extent that they would 
  be participating in an attack which did not comply with the political objectives, 
  adhered to by the organisation which they purport, in whose name they purport 
  to act, I would suggest that that is not then a legitimate political objective 
  which they were seeking to achieve.ADV DE JAGER: Would they have known 
  it?MR MLAMBISA: It is difficult to say whether they personally would 
  have known it, but they should certainly have been aware of the policies of 
  their party at the time.ADV DE JAGER: Would you suggest the policy of 
  their party wasn't to attack Whites at the time?ADV BEMBRIDGE: The policy 
  of the party was clearly not to carry out attacks of this nature at the time, 
  that is stated clearly by the representatives of those parties.ADV DE JAGER: 
  Would it be making any difference whether it was five farmers killed or five 
  people in the church?MR MLAMBISA: I think very much, with relation to 
  the question of the proximity and the proportionality of the attack, it makes 
  a very great difference, I submit. ADV DE JAGER: But not as far as the 
  object is concerned, political motive?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well, that very 
  question of proportionality and proximity is what is to be used in determining 
  whether it was in fact an act associated with the political objective.ADV 
  DE JAGER: Yes, that is what I ...JUDGE NGOEPE: You see, if you are 
  White you are White, even if you are in church or in a rugby stadium, if you 
  are White, you are White. Maybe you will develop that point much conveniently 
  later during argument.CHAIRMAN: Yes, proceed with your questions.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. Perhaps I can just put one more statement 
  to the applicant. Perhaps I can refer you to page 47 of the bundle, it forms 
  part of a press statement made by the PAC, relating to the armed struggle. If 
  I can just read that to you. It says there in the first paragraph on the top 
  of the page, in the militarised environment in our country of the 1990's in 
  the face of third force violence against our people and individuals in places 
  of worship and in trains and taxi's, internally based operatives often made 
  errors that APLA had earlier avoided. There was little political work done unlike 
  in the camps abroad. These were the causes of the departures in the 1990's which 
  we as political leaders who declared war must and do take responsibility for. 
  Even if war itself was forced upon us by the oppressor, the upholders of White 
  domination. Does that not amount to an admission that what you did was a departure 
  from APLA policy at the time?CHAIRMAN: Once again, let him see it if 
  he wishes to see it.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I thought he did have it in front 
  of him.MR MLAMBISA: Can I answer? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Go ahead.MR 
  MLAMBISA: As I've said before, we were forces on the ground. There were 
  also members of the High Command. They never told us the things that are written 
  down, we never knew about them. I think members of the High Command and the 
  leadership of the APLA can answer this question, but not me. We are only taking 
  orders from our Commander.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But the leadership today decided 
  that they would not come here to answer these questions for you.CHAIRMAN:	
  Would he know about that?MR MLAMBISA: No, I don't know.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Were you aware that at the time the attack on St James took place, that negotiations 
  were taking place to draft a new constitution for this country?MR MLAMBISA:	
  Yes, I knew.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why did you think that the attack at St James 
  was a better way of achieving democracy than those negotiations?MR MLAMBISA:	
  APLA was formed to fight, we are still waiting for someone to order us to stop 
  the fighting. So we were still fighting then up until we had orders to stop 
  the fighting. I am also sure that you also know that. The struggle was still 
  taking place, there was no suspension.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can I refer you 
  to page 70 of the bundle which is also a press statement from the PAC. In referring 
  to the negotiations that were going on at the time, they say throughout this 
  period the PAC adopted a positive outlook and urged the negotiating parties 
  to be principled. Consequently we played a positive role in the convening of 
  the multi-party negotiating forum which ultimately adopted the interim constitution 
  and paved the way for the democratic election of 1994. Are they not saying there 
  that the party in whose name you purported to act, encouraged rather participation 
  in the negotiations, than violent attacks?MR MLAMBISA: I am denying nothing, 
  it is like it said. As I've said before, we were taking orders from our Commanders, 
  but we never heard of any suspensions on the armed struggle that was only the 
  duty of the High Commander to tell us to stop the fighting. I wouldn't change 
  anything, I couldn't say anything. Only the Commanders would have told us and 
  if we don't obey orders, we will be in trouble.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you 
  Mr Chairman.ADV DE JAGER: Mr Bembridge, the PAC took part in negotiations. 
  They were the sort of, could we call it, the mother organisation, but APLA in 
  itself was also a known political organisation acting under its own Commanders 
  as far as I could gather. APLA itself never negotiated, is that correct?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: That is correct, as I understand it.ADV DE JAGER: Yes. 
  Right, thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: The suggestion is merely that in light 
  of their press statements, that the PAC being the mother organisation, was urging 
  principled action and positive participation then how could it have been the 
  objective of their military wing to contradict that?CHAIRMAN: Yes. As 
  far as this particular witness is concerned and the limited role that he played 
  in the matter, he couldn't be said to be aware of all the decisions taken at 
  the level of the High Command and was merely directly responsible to those who 
  were ordering him to do what he did. That is as far as it goes, isn't it, as 
  far as this applicant is concerned? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Except to the extent 
  we would suggest that the party itself was encouraging positive action, not 
  negative.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGECHAIRMAN: I understand. 
  Mr Brink, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?
NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK: Not for this applicant, thank you Mr 
  Chairman.CHAIRMAN: Any re-examination?
  NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MS GOZAADV DE JAGER: Mr Goza, could you kindly at this 
  stage, formulate exactly for what amnesty is being asked for in respect of which 
  offences? Because it is not very clear from the application.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes, they are out on bail and we don't know precisely what the charges against 
  them are, but I think that is a matter that must be cleared up after you have 
  dealt with the witnesses.MS GOZA: Mr Chairperson, can we perhaps in our 
  address after we have led the various evidence, attend to that aspect? Would 
  that be in order?CHAIRMAN: Yes. Very well. Yes, you may proceed.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, can we move on to applicant Makoma and can I hand 
  up the original of his affidavit, marked Exhibit C.CHAIRMAN: Yes, 
  please. The affidavit of Makoma will go onto the record as Exhibit C. 
  EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman. Thank you Mr Chairman, 
  if I may proceed to read into the record the affidavit of Gcinikhaya Christopher 
  Makoma. "I, the undersigned Gcinikhaya Christopher Makoma, do hereby make 
  oath and say that I am 21 years old and currently serving a sentence of 23 years 
  at the Victor Verster prison for eleven counts of murder, attempted murder and 
  three of the unlawful possession of arms and ammunition arising out of the St 
  James incident which took place on Sunday, the 25th of July 1993. The facts 
  to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless 
  the context indicates otherwise. I have made an application for amnesty in terms 
  of Section 18 of the Act, in respect of the charges of which I was found guilty 
  as well as the incident relating to the ambush of a police motor vehicle in 
  Khayelitsha. This application however, relates only to the amnesty application 
  in respect of the St James church incident. At the time of the incident, I was 
  17 years old. I was a member of the Pan African Congress and a member of the 
  African People's Liberation Army, APLA. I joined APLA in 1993. I was introduced 
  to Sichomiso Nonxuba by his code name Lester, by Vusi an APLA Commander approximately 
  three weeks before the St James attack. I was a member of Vusi's unit. Vusi 
  was going away for between two to three months and said to me that Lester was 
  going to take over the command of the unit. I met Lester for the first time 
  approximately three weeks before the attack. Mkhumbuzi was the only one of the 
  applicants in this matter whom I knew quite well before the attack. I met Mlambisa 
  for the first time when Lester introduced him to me on the Thursday before the 
  attack, at a house in Macassar. Mlambisa was introduced to me as Aubrey. I accompanied 
  Nonxuba, Lester and I gave Mlambisa a 9 mm pistol for his protection. When I 
  met Mlambisa, Nonxuba did not discuss any aspects of the operation. I was made 
  aware by Vusi that there would be an operation, but at the time the target was 
  unknown to me. The full compliment who would be involved in the operation met 
  for the first time on Sunday, 25 July 1993 at the Uluntu shopping centre. There 
  Nonxuba ordered me and Mlambisa to get a car and Mlambisa and I left together. 
  Although Nonxuba revealed no details of the operation to us, we knew that there 
  would be an attack. After we met, Mlambisa and I went to Crossroads and Guguletu 
  looking for a car. We found a car in Guguletu when it was already quite dark 
  and it was after six o'clock. We took this car at gunpoint, after we told the 
  driver that we were members of the PAC and APLA and that we only wanted to borrow 
  the car. The driver refused to voluntarily hand the car to us and I heard Mlambisa 
  firing a shot after which we got into the car and drove off. From there, we 
  went to Langa where we met Mkhumbuzi and Nonxuba at the taxi rank. After Nonxuba 
  and Mkhumbuzi got into the car, Nonxuba gave Mlambisa directions where to drive. 
  Nonxuba told me that I was to be part of the operation, but whilst in the car, 
  he never told me where the operation would take place. I knew that there were 
  guns and ammunition in the bag which was in the car. As we drove, Nonxuba told 
  met that I was to go inside the target with him. At that time I was not aware 
  that it was going to be the St James church. When we got to the target however, 
  I realised that it was a church. Nonxuba then told me that we were going to 
  be the main operators, he gave me a rifle and a handgrenade. I knew what this 
  would entail as I had received training in how to handle weapons and ammunition. 
  Mlambisa parked the car fairly close to the entrance of the church. We got out 
  of the car. I had no disguise and only put a cap on my head. When we entered 
  the church Nonxuba led the way and as we entered we were in a passage which 
  led to the main doors. People were walking up and down the passage. We left 
  off the passage for a few seconds and then Nonxuba said we will enter through 
  the main doors. Nonxuba then told me to throw the handgrenade and to shoot to 
  kill. Nonxuba led the way and we then burst through the doors of the church. 
  Nonxuba first threw his handgrenade, he was on my left hand side, and then I 
  threw mine. As the handgrenades exploded, we took cover behind the doors, re-entered 
  and while the people inside were screaming we started to shoot. We shot indiscriminately 
  and I finished my full R4 magazine, some 31 rounds of ammunition. We had also 
  heard a shot outside and a car screeching. We went back into the passage to 
  reload for our later protection. Inside the church one of the churchgoers had 
  also fired at us. As we left Nonxuba was in front and I turned back to shoot 
  at the person who shot at us. We got into the car and the car sped away. When 
  I was inside the car, I realised that I was bleeding. When we were inside the 
  car Nonxuba again directed Mlambisa where to drive. I subsequently learned that 
  it was a house in Ottery. Inside the house Nonxuba treated my injury with bandages. 
  I had suffered a cut on the left hand finger. The next day I left the house 
  with Mlambisa and went to Old Crossroads. I was later arrested at Unathi in 
  Old Crossroads on 5 August 1993. I admit that I was not truthful when I gave 
  evidence during my trial. I do, however, wish to reiterate that the notebook 
  which is referred to at pages 52 and 53 of the record which is before the Committee, 
  that that notebook belonged to Vusi although I had scribbled on some loose pages 
  which were found in the notebook. I had no idea that the St James church was 
  to be the target. It is now obvious, however, that Vusi and Nonxuba had known 
  of the operation for some time. As a member of APLA we operated under the slogan 
  "one settler, one bullet" and this to us meant that any White person 
  in South Africa was regarded as a settler and if we came across any settlers 
  during our operations, they had to be killed or injured. I now deeply regret 
  the loss of life and injury caused by me and the other applicants on 25 July 
  1993, and all I can ask for is that the family, relatives and friends of the 
  deceased and the other victims, forgive me. I respectfully submit that my application 
  complies with the requirements of the Act, that the offences that I have committed 
  were associated with a political objective as contemplated by the Act and that 
  I have made a full disclosure of all the facts relevant to the St James incident 
  and to this application. I accordingly, respectfully request that I be granted 
  amnesty in respect of the offences which I have committed and for which I have 
  been found guilty and I am currently serving a sentence". It is dated and 
  signed by Gcinikhaya Christopher Makoma on the 7th day of July 1997.
CHAIRMAN: Mr Makoma, will you just stand please to take the oath.GCINIKHAYA 
  CHRISTOPHER MAKOMA: (sworn states)MS KHAMPEPE: Thank you, you have 
  been properly sworn in.CHAIRMAN: Your counsel has read our your affidavit, 
  did you understand it?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I did.CHAIRMAN: And do you 
  confirm its contents?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I do.CHAIRMAN: Thank you. 
  Are there any questions you wish to put to this witness Mr Arendse?EXAMINATION 
  BY ADV ARENDSE: Yes, Mr Chairman. Mr Makoma, at the time on the 25th of 
  July 1993, you were a member of APLA is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes, 
  it is correct.ADV ARENDSE: Did APLA have any political objectives and 
  if so, what were these political objectives? MR MAKOMA: APLA had political 
  objectives. APLA is a military wing of the PAC, it was formed to fight the armed 
  struggle. It was fighting to bring back the African land to the owners whom 
  are known as Africans, who were taken by the Boers and they ruled. APLA was 
  the military wing, it was involved in the armed struggle, fighting the Whites, 
  fighting for the independence of the Blacks.ADV ARENDSE: Did you agree 
  with or associate yourself with that objective which you have just described?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, yes.ADV ARENDSE: Now Mr Makoma, you said in your affidavit, 
  that you entered the church with one other person, and that was Nonxuba, is 
  that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes, it is correct.ADV ARENDSE: Now we've 
  also heard my colleague here next to me, Mr Bembridge put it to your comrade 
  next to you that they will say that there were three people inside the church, 
  what do you say to that?MR MAKOMA: No, there were only two of us.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, if I could just for the record refer to page 1 of 
  the bundle handed in on behalf of the victims, that the summary of the facts 
  in paragraph 2, the last sentence in paragraph 2 alleges that while two guest 
  singers were singing a hymn on the stage, accused 1, that would be Sichomiso 
  Siphiwe Nonxuba and Makoma, the applicant, entered the church through a door 
  next to the stage. The accused carried machine guns, R4 rifles and handgrenades 
  which had wire nails glued to it. I just mention that for the record, because 
  that was the summary that was given to us as counsel in the criminal trial. 
  Now Mr Makoma you heard what I just read out to you about that it is alleged 
  here that you entered through a door next to the stage, would that be correct, 
  at the church at the time that you committed this deed?MR MAKOMA: I won't 
  say it was near the stage, but what I know is that we entered and on my left 
  side there was something like a pulpit. ADV ARENDSE: Is it correct that 
  you were armed with an R4 rifle and that you had a handgrenade on you?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, it is true.ADV ARENDSE: Can you just take that bundle 
  which is there by Bassie. Mr Chairman, I just want to refer to some matters 
  in the second bundle if I can call it that. CHAIRMAN: The second bundle.ADV 
  ARENDSE: No, not the record of this application. The bundle handed up by 
  my colleague, Mr Bembridge. CHAIRMAN: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Can you 
  turn to page 5 Mr Makoma. On page 5 and going onto page 6, your counsel at the 
  time Mr Desai who is now a Judge, read into the record in the criminal trial 
  a plea on your behalf, do you remember that?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I do remember.ADV 
  ARENDSE: You remember that you pleaded not guilty in respect of all the 
  charges against you?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Now obviously 
  at the time you were not telling the truth to the court when you pleaded not 
  guilty to the charges against you, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I 
  was not telling the truth. ADV ARENDSE: In the middle of the page on 
  page 5, round about lines 18 to 20, there is reference to a Task Group under 
  the leadership of Siphiwe Makweso and that this group was specifically informed, 
  it should be formed I suppose, to protect PAC leaders and members. I joined 
  the aforementioned group. Is that part of your statement, is that correct?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, it is true.ADV ARENDSE: Now, is it that Task Group that 
  took part in the attack on the St James church on that Sunday?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, it is not the Task Group, it is not the Task Force, it is APLA.ADV ARENDSE: 
  Is there a difference between the Task Group and APLA unit?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes, there is a difference.ADV ARENDSE: What is that difference?MR 
  MAKOMA: Task Force is one of the PAC alliances that was formed to protect 
  the PAC from the Branch originals to the National level?CHAIRMAN: What? 
  The Branch originals?MR MAKOMA: From Branch level to the National level, 
  protecting the PAC members.ADV ARENDSE: So would it be correct to say 
  that the functions of this Task Group or Force was different from the function 
  or task of an APLA unit when it is put into operation?MR MAKOMA: Yes. 
  ADV ARENDSE: Now, later on still on page 5, by way of explaining, you 
  remember you were arrested with this bag?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: 
  Now you explained that you got this bag from Siphiwe Makweso on the 5th of August 
  1993 at the Nyanga taxi rank, do you remember saying that in court?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Now, was that correct, was that the truth?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, it was not the truth.ADV ARENDSE: You also say in your plea explanation 
  that you were not a participant in the St James attack, was that the truth?MR 
  MAKOMA: No, it was not the truth.ADV ARENDSE: If you can turn to 
  page 6 at the top? You say there that at the time of the attack you were a standard 
  8 school boy at the Lulhaza High School, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes, 
  I was a student.ADV ARENDSE: The next part you say that you were not 
  a member of APLA or the military wing of any other political organisation and 
  that you do not believe that it is the policy of the PAC to perpetrate such 
  acts, was that the truth or was that correct?MR MAKOMA: No, it was not 
  the truth. ADV ARENDSE: And then the plea ends by you saying that at 
  the time you were with your girlfriend Francis Shally in Crossroads. Was that 
  the truth?MR MAKOMA: No, it was not the truth.ADV ARENDSE: In 
  fact, Mr Makoma, the court found that you were an untruthful witness during 
  the trial, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: You agree 
  with that finding?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I agree but not in everything.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Okay. We will try and deal with the not everything part now. Mr 
  Chairman, my learned friend Mr Brink suggests that I should suggest to you that 
  perhaps it is appropriate to take a short break.CHAIRMAN: We will adjourn 
  for 15 minutes.COMMISSION ADJOURNS FOR 15 MINUTES - ON RESUMPTION:CHAIRMAN: 
  Mr Arendse, you may proceed.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Makoma, 
  can I refer you to page 7 of the bundle that you have there. Now, page 7, 8 
  and 9 purports to be a statement which was taken from you. The date on page 
  7 on the top, right hand side, is 14 August 1993, do you remember that?MR 
  MAKOMA: I do see it.ADV ARENDSE: Now, if I can just refer the Committee 
  and my colleagues to page 48 of the record in regard to this statement which 
  I have referred to Mr Makoma, the Judge, Judge Marais in the criminal case said 
  that and I quote from line 6 onwards that we were not satisfied that it had 
  been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deprivation of sleep and the persistent 
  and continuous interrogation which immediately preceded the making of the statement 
  to Lester, played no significant causative role in the accused's decision to 
  make the statement. It is for those reasons that the statements made to Lester 
  were ruled to be inadmissible. Do you remember the Judge ruling that the statement 
  which I've referred you to and which is on pages 7, 8 and 9, that that statement 
  was not accepted into evidence by the court?MR MAKOMA: Are you talking 
  about the one in front of me?ADV ARENDSE: The one in front of you.MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Now, we are here before the Amnesty Committee 
  for you to reveal the true facts of what happened at the incident, when it took 
  place, before the incident, during the incident and after the incident, do you 
  accept that?MR MAKOMA: Can you please repeat what you have just said?ADV 
  ARENDSE: I am asking you do you accept that you are here before the Amnesty 
  Committee to say to the Committee exactly what happened before the incident 
  took place at St James, what happened during the incident and what happened 
  after the incident?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: And do you accept 
  that you must tell the truth about all those things to the Committee? MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Now, it is for that reason that I want to 
  take you through this statement even though the court ruled that it was not 
  acceptable to the court. Now, in the statement there is a constant reference 
  to a person called Vusi. Do you see that? In the statement there is constant 
  reference to Vusi.MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: There is also reference 
  to Bassie and it is spelt Bhasi, do you see that?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I can 
  see it.ADV ARENDSE: On page 8 there is also reference to Aubrey, yes?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, I can see that one too.ADV ARENDSE: Now, it may be put 
  to you or suggested to you that notwithstanding the fact that the criminal court 
  ruled this statement inadmissible, notwithstanding that fact, that ruling was 
  on technical grounds as it were, but and this is the point I want to make, but 
  that what is in the statement is really what happened before, during and after 
  the incident. What would your response be to such a proposition? That what is 
  contained in the statement is really what happened before, during and after 
  the incident?MR MAKOMA: No, it is not exactly it.ADV ARENDSE: 
  How did this statement come about? MR MAKOMA: What happened is this, 
  when I was arrested the policeman had already had their own information. They 
  already knew about the unit of APLA that was present at that moment and who 
  was the Commander. They already knew about the attack that happened. The names 
  Aubrey and Bhasi, they knew about them. Even my name too. But how did they find 
  them, I don't know. Some of the things, most of them, they questioned me about 
  were the things that were asking me, forcing me to say. So I was forced to accept 
  those things. The ones that I know and the ones that I don't know. So under 
  such circumstances I decided that instead of dying in the police cells, I must 
  make my own story. The one that could be closer to what they are telling me 
  to do. So that is how the statement came about.ADV ARENDSE: Now, the 
  court in your trial also rejected your allegations that you were amongst other 
  things, assaulted before or during making this statement or while making the 
  statement, the court rejected your allegations in that regard, do you remember 
  that?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I do remember.ADV ARENDSE: Well, what is 
  the true position then?MR MAKOMA: As I've said in the court that I was 
  tortured, beaten up and the statement that I made I was forced by the policemen 
  that they are real. I was forced to say yes to that. The names they were talking 
  about I had to accept them, but the problem that they had as policemen, they 
  couldn't identify the people they were talking about.JUDGE NGOEPE: Mr 
  Arendse, what exactly are we busy with now? Do you want to start another trial 
  within a trial or what are we busy with here, because as far as I understand 
  the situation, the statement on page 7 which seems to be troubling you, why 
  I don't understand, is that in the first place the trial court did not admit 
  it, it found it was inadmissible, for whatever reason. Your client has said 
  to us that it does not contain the truth at any rate. Why are we going to this 
  great length to investigate circumstances under which the statement was made 
  if the trial court had rejected it in any case and your client is also rejecting 
  it now. On what conceivable basis can it come into and be used here in our proceedings 
  before us against your client?ADV ARENDSE: Judge, thank you for asking 
  me that question. The questions around the statement are being put in anticipation 
  of what I believe my colleague, Mr Bembridge will be putting to the witness. 
  As I understand their case up until this point, they are opposing this application 
  on two grounds, the proportionality aspect and that these applicants are not 
  revealing the whole truth to the Committee. That is one reason. JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  That reason makes it immediately a question for re-examination because I mean 
  you can't re-examine in advance. You would have to wait and see to what length 
  Mr Bembridge is going to go and then deal with it in re-examination because 
  you keep on anticipating, maybe you are mis-anticipating and then we don't know, 
  you see, that is why I am asking, we don't know how far we are going to go in 
  the process of trying to anticipate the cross-examination, particularly if the 
  basis of this statement is so dubious.ADV ARENDSE: Judge, can I answer 
  that in three parts? JUDGE NGOEPE: He may not even talk about it, Mr 
  Bembridge may not even refer to it.ADV ARENDSE: Firstly, with due respect 
  it is a perfectly legitimate tactic or aspect of leading the evidence of your 
  client to anticipate what the opposition is coming to say or do. Secondly the 
  processes, the criminal trial and this process are entirely different. If there 
  is in fact, and that seems to be your prima facie view, that this statement 
  should be thrown out completely because another court has already in its opinion 
  given a ruling on it, then if the Committee is agreed that that is the case 
  then believe me I would be the first one to accept it and I won't have to deal 
  with it. JUDGE NGOEPE: No, you don't understand my point. The question 
  of legitimate anticipation is a fair one, but you missed the point. There must 
  be a basis for it, for anticipation and it is not for me to say that we will 
  throw that statement out, your client has said it does not contain the truth.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Judge, the other reason which I think is a compelling reason why 
  we should deal with it and why I rather deal with it, is that the question can 
  legitimately be put to him that the names Vusi, Aubrey, Bhasi, there is mention 
  of a Datsun vehicle, are mentioned in the statement, be it that it was ruled 
  inadmissible, it is also mentioned in your statement before the Commission, 
  it is also mentioned by the others. We now know as a fact that Vusi exists or 
  existed. We know as a fact that Aubrey ... JUDGE NGOEPE: I suppose we 
  can proceed, but I sincerely hope that we are not going to go into a trial within 
  a trial on the allegations of assault by the police and all that sort of thing.CHAIRMAN: 
  Wouldn't it be, sorry, wouldn't it meet the requirements if you just cleared 
  up with your client that to the extent that his evidence here, differs from 
  the contents of his statement, he maintains that what he is now saying, is the 
  truth? Now, then if you are going to suggest to him that some of what he said 
  in that statement was suggested by the police, or by anybody else to him, to 
  say, then you may point out that. Point that out, but I think that it will be 
  appropriate if we proceeded along the lines as suggested by my brother, the 
  other side know by now that there are differences between what is contained 
  in his statement and what he is saying here now under oath and in his affidavit.	
  So, I think that there can't be too much dispute, everybody knows that there 
  are these differences. If it is your intention now to go through each point 
  of difference between his evidence here now and what is contained in that statement, 
  then I think that you are overstepping the mark.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you 
  Mr Chairman. Mr Makoma, it has been put to your other comrades already, that 
  you would have been aware that the St James church was a target, even before 
  the killings took place. What do you say to that?MR MAKOMA: I do agree 
  with my fellow Africans, nobody knows about it except the Commander.ADV ARENDSE: 
  Tell us a bit more about Vusi, is Vusi and Nonxuba are they one and the same 
  person, are they different persons? MR MAKOMA: They are two different 
  people.ADV ARENDSE: Who was Vusi?MR MAKOMA: He was one of the 
  APLA Commanders.ADV ARENDSE: Was he involved in the attack?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, he was not involved. ADV ARENDSE: Was Nonxuba involved in the attack?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, he was involved.ADV ARENDSE: What role did he play?MR 
  MAKOMA: He was the Commander, everything that happened we did that under 
  his instructions.ADV ARENDSE: So he led the attack, he led the attack?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: Can you turn to page 31 of that bundle? 
  Now, you see I don't know whose handwriting it is, but we are not going to put 
  that in issue, there is a comment there from Barney Desai, do you see that name 
  there?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I can see.ADV ARENDSE: Do you know who he 
  is? Barney Desai?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I know Barney Desai.ADV ARENDSE: 
  He is high up in the PAC is he?MR MAKOMA: Yes. 
  ADV ARENDSE: Now in the last three lines there on page 31 he says, "We 
  condemn this mindless violence on churchgoing people". He is referring 
  to the St James attack. Do you want to comment on that?MR MAKOMA: The 
  only thing I can say African Barnie Desai is the leader of the PAC and the APLA, 
  is the military wing of the PAC and the attack that happened in the St James 
  church, was led by one of the High Commanders in APLA. Then in 1993 when he 
  was commenting as he is saying here, I can understand as he is the politician 
  and during those days we knew that the struggle was still in power. On behalf 
  of the APLA, I think the members of the PAC are not involved in the operations 
  done by APLA. Only APLA members that are involved and they are the only ones 
  who can come with clear information in anything that has been done by APLA.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Thank you. Now, if you turn to page 36, this has been referred 
  to by my colleague Mr Bembridge already, I think he put it to Thobela, do you 
  see page 36?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I can see it.
ADV ARENDSE: You see there APLA denies involvement in massacre and then 
  on the next page, I think quite properly pointed out by Adv De Jager at the 
  time, that in Afrikaans, in the middle sort of in the paragraph next to these 
  identikits there is in Afrikaans, you don't have to read it, but the sum total 
  of what that says is again where the organisation accepts responsibility for 
  what happened. Now, I want you to comment just on the denial that you see there 
  on page 36. Did you see that? I suppose on the 26th of July you had been arrested, 
  you had been in prison at the time, awaiting trial, weren't you?MR MAKOMA: 
  When?ADV ARENDSE: Sorry, this is the day after the incident, sorry, I 
  am getting confused now with the matter before this. July the 26th was just 
  after the killings. You are from Cape Town is that right?MR MAKOMA: Yes, 
  that is right.ADV ARENDSE: Is this from the Argus, do you read the Argus?MR 
  MAKOMA: Only when I've got money I do buy Argus.ADV ARENDSE: But 
  did you see this, did you read this particular article then?MR MAKOMA: 
  No.ADV ARENDSE: Now, Mr Makoma, you know what you did. The carnage that 
  you inflicted on the churchgoers attending the church at the time, resulting 
  in the death of 11 persons and injury, some of them maiming people for life, 
  like the Russian gentleman whose letter was read to you yesterday, to us yesterday. 
  What is your view of that now, how do you view what you did? How do you feel 
  about it today?MR MAKOMA: What I can say is this, to those relatives 
  whose loved ones have been killed and those who had injured, and those who were 
  badly hurt, as I was deeply involved in that mess, I threw a handgrenade, I 
  fired shots obeying the instructions from my Commander, that resulted in what 
  we are talking today about, I do regret and please forgive me because it was 
  the situation in South Africa at that time. And as a soldier, obeying instructions 
  from the Commander, I was trained that the Commander is the only one that gives 
  the instructions. You don't have to question that. You don't have to deny that. 
  Do as you are told. I as Khaya, as I was deeply involved in this, but there 
  was nothing I could do, to let this not happen because this was an order from 
  above and as a soldier I had to obey the instructions. I am so sorry, please 
  forgive me. To those who had been injured and their loved ones who passed away. 
  I know there is no one who had the right to kill. But the situation in South 
  Africa led us as we were young as we were, to do those things because we grew 
  up in a violent country. We were seeing our fellow Africans being shot and killed 
  by the Whites. All in all, I don't know if you grew up in such circumstances, 
  wouldn't you expect such things to happen because we were not involved in the 
  struggle because we wanted to, we were forced by the situations. There is nothing 
  I can say. If you do forgive me, or you don't, it is all up to you. But the 
  information you wanted to know who did this, I as Khaya, I told them what I 
  did and how was I involved. That is all, thank you.ADV ARENDSE: How do 
  you feel towards or about White people now, today?MR MAKOMA: What I can 
  say today, it is a new South Africa and I also know that this new South Africa 
  came through struggle by the Africans. So the Whites are also people, we were 
  not fighting them because they were White, we were fighting them because of 
  their deeds as the White nation. If today, as I am listening on television and 
  radio, because I am in prison, they said there is peace amongst the Africans, 
  Whites and Blacks, I am happy to see that. As Whites they are not looking to 
  Black people as animals that were supposed to be killed, armed or not armed, 
  sleeping or alive, young or old, because what they did were not directed to 
  old people, they were directed to the youth as Africans, as part of the African 
  nation, we made a decision that we won't tolerate such a thing. So, when there 
  is peace, I am also prepared to take them as human beings. If they are also 
  taking Africans as human beings, people who have the right to live, to go anywhere, 
  to say anything independently because by the time we were involved in this mess, 
  such things couldn't happen. And as we were young, blood was still very hot, 
  we couldn't tolerate those things. I don't say that gives me the power or the 
  will to go out and kill as I wish. I was obeying the instructions from my Commander. 
  As he couldn't come forward and agree to this because he passed away, because 
  it is clear that we are the ones that have to answer. I am saying to the parents, 
  those who lost their children, injured, we are very sorry. Not because of the 
  St James massacre, but in everything that happened under the name of APLA, because 
  it was the situation in South Africa during those days. We were also forced 
  to do such things. I am finished, thank you.ADV ARENDSE: Khaya, we now 
  know that there were not only White people in the church, there were also so-called 
  Coloured people in the church. Were you aware of that fact at the time? MR 
  MAKOMA: No, I as Khaya I didn't know that.ADV ARENDSE: Did you assume 
  that there were only White people going to be present in the church or at the 
  target?MR MAKOMA: As far as I know, APLA was fighting the Whites. So 
  when we were going to attack there, I assumed that we were fighting the Whites. 
  As I was inside the church, I didn't notice anyone who is not a White. Even 
  if that person was there, the order said I must shoot, throw the handgrenade, 
  I couldn't reject that because I was trained that the instructions are not disobeyed.ADV 
  ARENDSE: The Judge in the trial, when he found you guilty said, and Mr Chairman 
  I am referring to page 50 of the record, the line 5 or so from the bottom, he 
  said - Khaya, it is not in front of you there, I just want to read the portion 
  of the sentence there which says that the attack could only have been committed 
  to serve a political objective. That is what the Judge said in your case, do 
  you agree with that finding of the Judge?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I do agree with 
  that.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman, I have got no further questions.JUDGE 
  WILSON: Before you stop Mr Arendse, I am afraid I am totally confused and 
  I would like to clarify something and I don't want you to think that I am reopening 
  the question. You told us of a statement made by this witness which was introduced 
  as evidence at the trial and which the Judge rejected.ADV ARENDSE: That 
  is right.JUDGE WILSON: Is that so? ADV ARENDSE: Yes.JUDGE WILSON: 
  You then referred to pages 7, 8 and 9 of the bundle.ADV ARENDSE: Of the 
  bundle handed in, yes.JUDGE WILSON: Handed in, yes. Now that is a statement 
  made by the applicant, it was not introduced in the trial, no ruling was made 
  about it. Is that not so?ADV ARENDSE: Judge, I do see that this is a 
  statement that appears to have been taken by Don Segal.JUDGE WILSON: 
  Yes, it was not the statement that was handed in at the trial, it is not the 
  statement that the trial Judge made a ruling about.ADV ARENDSE: Yes, 
  no I accept that.JUDGE WILSON: So it is totally irrelevant from that 
  point of view?ADV ARENDSE: The only relevance Judge, with due respect...JUDGE 
  WILSON: The statement made at the trial, is at page 10.ADV ARENDSE: 
  Ten of the bundle?JUDGE WILSON: Ten of the bundle handed in. It goes 
  on from there. ADV ARENDSE: Well, with due respect Judge, regardless 
  of which statement one is referring to ...JUDGE WILSON: I just want to 
  know why you introduced the other one.ADV ARENDSE: Because I was under 
  the bona fide impression that that is the statement that I wanted to 
  deal with and that is the statement that was rejected, if it was a mistake...JUDGE 
  WILSON: It was a mistake, we can just ignore it?ADV ARENDSE: Well, 
  but I am nevertheless pleased with the answers that the witness gave in regard 
  even to this statement that was apparently made to Segal, because I wanted to 
  tie up the names that are mentioned in the statement on pages 7, 8 and 9 with 
  what is found in his statement to this Committee. I don't have any further questions, 
  Mr Chairman.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSECHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Mr Chairman, I am in somewhat of a difficult situation at this 
  stage. I have been approached by Mr Lorenzo Smith, who is one of the victims 
  whom I represent, he has advised that he is due to leave for Bloemfontein at 
  one o'clock. We did not anticipate that we would not be able to lead his evidence 
  before this time. He has asked me to request the Committee whether there is 
  any possibility of some arrangement being made or some plan being made to allow 
  him to in fact give his evidence before he leaves at one o'clock and whether 
  some departure from the normal procedure would be considered by the Committee 
  in these circumstances? He will naturally abide by whatever finding the Committee 
  makes.CHAIRMAN: Have you any objection to that Mr Arendse? ADV ARENDSE: 
  No, Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink?MR BRINK: No, Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: 
  Well, Mr Bembridge, you may do so, call your witness.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I 
  am indebted to the Committee for its indulgence and to my learned friends. We 
  then call Mr Lorenzo Smith.CHAIRMAN: Yes, please. We will have to place 
  Mr Smith somewhere near a microphone. Can he take one of these microphones please. 
  Mr Smith, will you please stand. LORENZO VICTOR SMITH: (sworn states)CHAIRMAN: 
  Thank you. What are your full names?MR SMITH: My full names are Lorenzo 
  Victor Smith.CHAIRMAN: Yes, you may proceed.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank 
  you Mr Chairman. Mr Smith, it is correct that you are a parishioner at the St 
  James church in Kenilworth, is that correct? MR SMITH: That is correct.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: How long have you been a parishioner there?MR SMITH: Plus 
  minus five years.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And you were in the church on the evening 
  of the attack on that church in 1993?MR SMITH: That is correct.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Can you tell the Committee something about the make-up of the 
  congregation in St James?MR SMITH: Well the congregation, the church 
  is open to all nationalities, irrespective to colour, creed, etc. We go there 
  to worship God and that is all that we do.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is your 
  reaction to the suggestion that the attack on the St James church was justified 
  as being an attack against White people?MR SMITH: I feel that the church 
  is a place of sanctuary and looking at the way it was constructed, it was preplanned 
  and being preplanned, the church itself has got no political aspect as to what 
  is actually put across the board. If it was that which I see looking at it, 
  whoever came to the church to preplan it, they could actually identify the amount 
  of people and the different nationalities that were at the church at any given 
  time on a Sunday evening or any other evenings.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you 
  describe what those nationalities and groups of people were?MR SMITH:	
  We have Russians, we have Muslims, we have Christians, Black, White, Chinamen, 
  you name it, it attends the church. ADV BEMBRIDGE: And you say that is 
  so on any evening at the church?MR SMITH: At any given time of worship, 
  you will find that the same mixed crowd attending the church.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  And on the night that the attack took place, what was the make-up of the congregation 
  on that evening?MR SMITH: Man, it was similar although the weather allowing 
  many people not to attend, but nevertheless it was the same sort of amount, 
  90 percent was mixed in the church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I understand that evening 
  you had a large contingent of Russian sailors.MR SMITH: We had.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: What role did they play at the church?MR SMITH: To hear 
  the gospel.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Were they regularly in attendance there?MR 
  SMITH: Yes, for about three years they were regular attenders there.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Would it have been evident to someone going into the church that 
  there were Russian people present, were any adjustments made to the ceremony 
  itself to allow for them?MR SMITH: Yes, at a later stage, the service 
  would actually come to a pause where the Russians would actually leave the service 
  and would have a special service, translated in Russian at a smaller sort of 
  hall with an interpreter in English. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you describe 
  what the missionary policies of the church were?MR SMITH: To save souls 
  and to preach the gospel.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you do any missionary work 
  outside the Kenilworth area?MR SMITH: I belong to the organisation with 
  Russians at one stage, my late wife and myself.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What about 
  in any of the poorer areas of the Western Cape?MR SMITH: Well, on a normal 
  basis I would go out, whoever I would meet, colleagues, workmates and speak 
  to them about the good news of salvation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did the church 
  perform any missionary work in the township areas?MR SMITH: They do.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: What was the nature of that work?MR SMITH: Again to preach 
  the gospel of salvation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I understand also that the church 
  has affiliated churches inside some of the township areas?MR SMITH: They 
  do. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where are they?MR SMITH: I could be - I know 
  of a few of them, there is one is Khayelitsha, there is one in what is the place's 
  name, Lavender Hill and they have many other smaller churches around too.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Do people from those churches ever visit at the Kenilworth, St 
  James church?MR SMITH: They do at given times.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And 
  do you from St James, visit those churches in the townships?MR SMITH:	
  We do.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is your comment on the suggestion or any suggestion 
  that maybe made that the applicants as victims of apartheid or as representatives 
  of apartheid, were therefore justified in furthering the struggle against apartheid 
  and in attempting to achieve the ends of that struggle, in committing this attack 
  upon the church?MR SMITH: Again I do emphasise the point that the church 
  is a neutral place, a place of worship and it is open to all nationalities. 
  Why choose a church of that nature to have the grievances with?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Do you consider what happened at the church that evening, to be a gross violation 
  of your human rights?MR SMITH: I do.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you describe 
  briefly what happened? MR SMITH: It was a normal evening, Sunday evening. 
  Unfortunately we were blessed with a thunder storm, that many fellow Christians 
  couldn't attend, but nevertheless it never kept myself and my late wife and 
  my children from attending the service. We attended, we normally when we reached 
  the church, we located ourselves in seating places where we regularly sat in 
  and that evening my wife said to me, darling, could I just move one seat forward. 
  I thought to myself one seat forward? I asked her what is the reason, she said 
  well, the teenagers were making a noise in the background. We normally sit right 
  at the back, about 25 rows from the front, right at the back of the church, 
  that is our normal seating places. During the service, what drew my attention, 
  the way the door on the left hand side was opened. One person entered the church. 
  At that time I thought it was a hoax, he lodged a handgrenade and started firing.	
  I thought at that stage it was fire crackers, they were probably playing you 
  know, some (indistinct), whatever you call it. But then when I saw the people 
  actually taking cover and falling, I said to the crowd and my wife, take cover, 
  this is for real. At that time, the first person that actually emptied his rifle, 
  his automatic rifle, walked back to the door when the second party walked in 
  and stood in the centre on the one side, because there are two isles and he 
  emptied his rifle. Then he walked towards the door. But I could see everything 
  because where I was laying, I thought to myself I am protected and I am protecting 
  my wife because I was laying right on top of her and thinking that if anything 
  should happen, the shot will actually take flight and it will never reach us 
  because we are on a higher plane, but the second party walked back to the isle 
  after he had emptied his rifle and he lodged a handgrenade right up the isle 
  which actually landed about a metre and a half away from me. And that handgrenade 
  actually caused my wife's death and many others that were in that vicinity at 
  the time, the second handgrenade. To me it was canny to think that here I protected 
  her with my body, nothing was wrong, I never had a scratch on me, but here my 
  wife had the shrapnel that actually went right through her, right through her 
  heart and she only lived for about 10 minutes of that and she was gone.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: There were, I understand about 1 300 people in the church that 
  night?MR SMITH: That is right.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What were the age 
  groups represented there?MR SMITH: We have various age groups, we have 
  from minors going right up to if you are fit enough to attend the church, the 
  church will be open to you. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Could you describe the scene 
  in the church after the attack, what took place after the attack?MR SMITH: 
  It was a miracle I will say, because the Lord's hand was over each individual 
  that suffered that evening and I feel that although he allowed it to happen, 
  the outcome of things that we only see today, we don't know why, but we know 
  that the outcome of things was for a reason. And I felt that my wife died in 
  the presence of serving him. I have no animosity, the way that she died, but 
  the way she was killed, I disagree that a person can go out to take someone 
  else's live in that manner. I feel that we believe in prayer, and through prayer 
  we were actually set free from this whole situation that this country was in. 
  Violence had maybe on the brink at time, had taken place but it wasn't through 
  violence, it was through prayer and if you go back into the Bible itself, it 
  states there that people were suffering in bondage and they were set free at 
  the time, but through prayer. For 40 years they had prayed, people had suffered, 
  Christians had suffered, but at a given time, the Lord set them free. And this 
  is what I felt too that at the given time, we will be set free. If you look 
  at the country's situation and economics, you could actually see we were going 
  to a slump. We were being boycotted by other countries and violence wouldn't 
  add any help to the situation that we were in.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr Smith 
  is it so that you were, yourself, discriminated against under the system of 
  apartheid?MR SMITH: That is true. I was brought up in District Six, I 
  can identify with the struggle of the Blacks. My late father was White, he had 
  to actually class himself as a Coloured, reclassified himself. I never had the 
  privilege of seeing my grandparents, because at that stage, if you had reclassified 
  yourself, there had to be no dealings with either the White or Coloured. My 
  dad said to me at one stage, when he was alive, he said you know, the heartache 
  that this country has come across, has affected many a person and until you 
  see reason that you can forgive that things do come to a change, that is before 
  he died, he accepted Christ within his life too and I was so grateful for that, 
  because this was part that I could see the outcome of things, what happened 
  through the St James massacre. But nevertheless we stayed in District Six, we 
  had to evacuate District Six because of the Group Areas Act, we had to go to 
  other areas. It was good and it was bad, because I feel that people staying 
  in that area was pushed further back where they couldn't attend jobs, etc, because 
  of transport, but to have the option of buying their own homes, so in a way 
  it was good and in a way it was bad. So I could relate to the way the Blacks 
  were feeling and certain places that you weren't allowed to go would be, it 
  was either White or Coloured. I've been overseas, travelled overseas as a Seaman 
  at many places and what is worse to go to a country where it is not practised 
  by the government, but you get social discrimination which is worse when in 
  the country you stay, you knew where you were on and off. And I knew at a given 
  time, things will change. As it was introduced in this country, 40 years prior, 
  it would change at a given time.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you as a victim of 
  apartheid, not consider that there was any justification in the means used in 
  this attack to achieve the ends which allegedly was sought to be achieved by 
  it? MR SMITH: I do.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you feel there was some justification 
  in the attack?MR SMITH: There was justification which I feel to their 
  part, they felt there was justification, but I feel that what they had looked 
  at, the target that they had chosen, was not the right target to choose, to 
  bring their motive to the media.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Are you satisfied from 
  your own experience from these events, that the applicants have made full disclosure 
  of the relevant facts?MR SMITH: Man, what I've heard, we actually have 
  to take an oath to actually tell the truth as to what had actually happened 
  at that day. But what I heard of the colleagues sitting in front, right in front 
  of me at the end, he mentioned that two of them came in at the same time. I 
  recall sitting right at the back, only one came in, one fired, the other one 
  was standing at the back. There was someone at the door, I couldn't see him, 
  but the door was ajar, it was open. The one went back again and the gentleman 
  sitting in front of me, he entered in. As he said he entered in, but he entered 
  in, he is the one who opened up fire, walked back to the door, came back to 
  the isle and lodged the handgrenade, but what I heard what he said that they 
  went back into the isle, reloaded and then lodged the handgrenade, so where 
  is the truth of what actually happened? Doesn't he recall what actually happened 
  at the time?ADV BEMBRIDGE: From what you observed that night, how many 
  people came into the church to attack it?MR SMITH: I saw two people coming 
  into the church at different intervals and I presume there was a third person, 
  because the door was ajar.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You didn't see the person?MR 
  SMITH: I never saw him. ADV BEMBRIDGE: What conclusion did you draw 
  from the manner in which the attack was carried out, as you've just described 
  it?MR SMITH: Man, to me it was a military organised attack, that is all 
  that I can say.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is your response to the suggestion 
  that it was only the Commander who had any knowledge of the target or the nature 
  of the attack, that the other people who were involved in this or was carrying 
  out, had no such knowledge?MR SMITH: I believe that we have a will and 
  a right to refuse things when we come face to face with it and each and every 
  one out there that were involved in the incident, had at the given time a chance 
  to make that decision. Yes, or no, if they are going to go through with what 
  was happening, what is going to take place.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What then are 
  your feelings as to whether these applicants should be granted amnesty in these 
  circumstances?MR SMITH: I feel that if amnesty is granted, it must be 
  granted on a truthful basis and that is it.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you think 
  it can in the circumstances be granted on a truthful basis?MR SMITH:	
  Well, what I've heard, I have mixed feelings, that is all.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  Do you think these applicants should be granted amnesty?MR SMITH: If 
  they are telling the truth, yes, if they are not, then justice should take its 
  course.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you briefly just describe what the effects 
  were on the church community itself, effects of this attack? MR SMITH: 
  I can speak for myself. I am going through major, I wouldn't say myself, I have 
  remarried, I will be married in August for two years. Just through the grace 
  of God I met a beautiful woman, she is fantastic, I love her dearly. I have 
  put the past back about my wife, I accepted her death. She has gone home, she 
  has gone to a place that I look forward to in being. My children are suffering 
  tremendously. There are times when my wife too, she feels that she is inadequate 
  to fill a gap of a mother, she is a parent, but of a mother. I have got a daughter 
  of 18 years old, there are given times when I didn't know her. I said to her, 
  this is going to be a lifetime for you to go through the situation that you 
  are in. I have a son that is 23, he is doing his Master degree in Marine Biology, 
  he doesn't speak. He doesn't speak about the incident. He has got a deep, deep 
  sort of trauma about it. He says he is feeling okay, but I know he is not. And 
  I feel that it is going to take them a lifetime to overcome. I have accepted 
  it, I have put my wife behind my back, and I accepted her death, but the way 
  she died, I feel it is not right for any human being to take life in that manner.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Have you observed any similar symptoms in any other members of 
  the community?MR SMITH: I have.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman.
  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGE
  CHAIRMAN: Thank you. Are there any questions that counsel wishes to put 
  to this witness, Mr Arendse?ADV ARENDSE: Very reluctantly, yes Mr Chairman. 
  Mr Smith, we coincidentally know each other. Can I just share with you the regret 
  and sorrow of what happened on that day.MR SMITH: Thank you. ADV ARENDSE: 
  I don't wish it on anybody and we have instructions also from the applicants 
  to convey their deep regret to you about the death of your wife and the death 
  of other people. Mr Smith, can I just read back to you what Mr Makoma said in 
  his statement about what actually happened in church? He says when we, because 
  I am just reading it back to you because I think perhaps you either didn't hear 
  properly or it didn't come over to you correctly what he actually said. When 
  we entered the church, Nonxuba, who is also deceased, led the way and as we 
  entered, we were in a passage which led to the main doors. People were walking 
  up and down the passage. We left off the passage for a few seconds and then 
  Nonxuba said we will enter through the main doors. He told me to throw the handgrenade 
  and to shoot to kill. That was presumably now in the passage as they - Nonxuba 
  led the way and we burst through the doors of the church. He first threw his 
  handgrenade, he was on my left, that is on this applicant, Makoma's left, and 
  then I threw mine. As the handgrenades exploded, we took cover behind the doors, 
  re-entered and while people were screaming, we started to shoot. We shot indiscriminately 
  and finished the respective R4 magazines, collectively must have been about 
  62 rounds of ammunition. That is what he says what happened. Doesn't that approximate 
  ...MR SMITH: No, it doesn't. I would like to ask you if that is his true 
  statement that he made across?ADV ARENDSE: It is, he said so under oath.MR 
  SMITH: Well, what I've seen and there is many in the church that can verify 
  the same thing, what I've seen on oath, he came in. The second person that came 
  in, it was him, right, he first shot before he emptied out his rifle, walked 
  a couple of paces to the door, turned back again to the isle and lodged the 
  handgrenade. I was sitting at a place where I could see everything from the 
  distance where I was sitting. To me there is a miss, sort of evidence that he 
  is giving.ADV ARENDSE: Now, you are saying applicant Makoma did this? 
  MR SMITH: He came in the second time, that is what I am saying.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Did you see him clearly?MR SMITH: I can't see, I know it 
  is a Black person. I am short sighted, I know it is Black person, he verified 
  that he came into the church, I have to take his word for it, but that is what 
  I've seen.ADV ARENDSE: So you can't even say for sure whether he was 
  in the church? We know now that he was?MR SMITH: What I can say, I definitely 
  know at the given time, there was two different people who entered the church, 
  and not at the same time.ADV ARENDSE: Okay, firstly it is two people 
  only?MR SMITH: It is two people only and the door was ajar, the door 
  swing closed when there is nothing keeping the door ajar.ADV ARENDSE: 
  So it is not three people who came into the church?MR SMITH: Not three 
  in the church, two entered at different times.ADV ARENDSE: So when my 
  colleague Mr Bembridge put it to one of the applicants that it was three people, 
  he was - that was not your instructions?MR SMITH: Man, to me - I said 
  there must have been a third party because the door cannot be ajar at that for 
  them, for the door to be ajar, because the door is a swing door, it will close 
  by itself.ADV ARENDSE: So you are prepared to accept that there were 
  only two killers in the church? MR SMITH: There were two that came in 
  at different intervals into the church.JUDGE NGOEPE: Just for the record, 
  Mr Bembridge said there were presumably three people.ADV ARENDSE: I am 
  prepared to accept that thank you, and I recall now actually that he said that 
  Mr Smith, Mr Lorenzo Smith will say, that there were three or as the Judge corrected 
  me, presumably three. You are now sure that there were two?MR SMITH: 
  There were two, but as I say a door cannot be ajar when it has a spring loaded 
  onto it, it will close up by itself.ADV ARENDSE: It is a swing door?MR 
  SMITH: A swing door.ADV ARENDSE: Yes.MR SMITH: So if the door 
  closes by itself, you know, to me something definitely that is keeping the door 
  open.ADV ARENDSE: How quickly did this all happen, did it happen quickly 
  or did it take some time?MR SMITH: This thing must have taken plus minus, 
  over a minute to a minute and a half. And you can say you can see a lot in a 
  minute and a half. You can ask me how do you see in a minute and a half, all 
  these things.ADV ARENDSE: Yes.MR SMITH: If you are concentrating 
  on one thing and your attention is taken away, the way it was, you have full 
  sort of focus on what is actually taking place and that is actually what I was 
  doing. ADV ARENDSE: So why couldn't you identify Mr Makoma?MR SMITH: 
  As I said to you I am short sighted. I cannot see further. You put anything 
  in front of me, faces are vague at the distance of that nature, but I just know 
  they weren't covered up, their faces weren't covered up. They were dark skinned 
  people and two people came in at different times.ADV ARENDSE: Was there 
  any other distinguishing feature of Mr Makoma's.MR SMITH: Man, they had 
  darkish coloured clothes, that is all and what I could say was what I've seen 
  and that is what I have seen.ADV ARENDSE: Did they wear anything on their 
  heads?CHAIRMAN: I don't think he was attempting to identify anybody.MR 
  SMITH: The one had a cap on.CHAIRMAN: I don't think he is attempting 
  to identify anyone.ADV ARENDSE: If the Chairman just allows me perhaps 
  another question, I will get to the point.CHAIRMAN: Yes.ADV ARENDSE: 
  Sorry, I didn't hear that Mr Smith? MR SMITH: The one had a cap on. A 
  cap on his head, like a balaclava. As I said to you the way they came in, they 
  never came in disguised. You could actually make sure that those were the people, 
  so what they actually did meant that whoever is going to actually identify them, 
  they weren't concerned about it. They actually came to the church, fully prepared 
  whatever gives, whatever the cost may be, that is what they are going to do.ADV 
  ARENDSE: We all know that, we accept that that they were prepared, that 
  it was planned. Did you make a statement to the police along the lines that 
  you ...MR SMITH: There are so many that made statements to the police 
  at the stage, I felt that - to the press I spoke many a time to the press and 
  in my affidavit to the press you can actually read what I am actually speaking 
  about, it is the same thing, nothing changed from that time to now.ADV ARENDSE: 
  So you didn't make a statement to the police?MR SMITH: I never made a 
  statement to the police.ADV ARENDSE: And you never testified in court?MR 
  SMITH: Man, to me I tried to I wouldn't say shield away from it, but I don't 
  look at news, because I look at positive things, not negative things. When these 
  accused were trailed, someone came to me and said do you know that the perpetrators 
  of St James had appeared. I said what, he said, don't you read the news, and 
  I said I don't buy newspapers.ADV ARENDSE: Yes.MR SMITH: Because 
  I believe in a positive way and that is the way I look at things. Not the negative 
  way of bad stuff to run you down when you get up in the morning and look at 
  the news. That is all that you see, violence, crime, corruption. ADV ARENDSE: 
  Yes. In 1993, there was violence, crime, corruption, do you accept that?MR 
  SMITH: Well, to a certain degree I do.ADV ARENDSE: Do you accept 
  that there was violence perpetrated against Black people, African people by 
  the State, by the police, people were shot and killed?MR SMITH: Yes, 
  I believe so through hearing from others.ADV ARENDSE: Well, from what 
  you read in the newspapers, I take it at the time perhaps, you ...MR SMITH:	
  Maybe not fully on the newspaper. I am not politically minded. As I said to 
  you, I don't involve in any of the political situations that is in. To the matter 
  of fact, I don't even know who - our President I do know is Mandela, but the 
  rest of it, I don't even know.ADV ARENDSE: But you were born in District 
  Six?ADV DE JAGER: Could I ask Mr Smith, Mr Smith in fact whatever way 
  we look at it, there is a confession that they in fact killed your wife. They 
  don't deny that today. Whether she was killed by a bullet or by shrapnel, he 
  even wouldn't know, but that wouldn't pardon him. What he had done was according 
  to the law wrong, he had been convicted and sentenced for murder. So, we are 
  not disputing and I don't think anybody could dispute that as far as the law 
  is concerned, he is guilty, he had been found guilty of murder and it was murder. 
  So that is not what is at issue today. The only thing we have got to consider, 
  is whether in terms of the Act, amnesty could be granted and in that respect 
  I don't think, it is necessary Mr Arendse, to go into details and try to let's 
  be honest, nobody could have observed everything that happened there, it happened 
  in seconds. So I believe Mr Smith is honestly relating what he in fact saw. 
  And I don't think it would be of any advantage to us, it could serve any purpose 
  if perhaps he had seen things differently from what the applicant said. It couldn't 
  help us in coming to a decision.CHAIRMAN: This put on the basis that 
  what this witness, Mr Smith now says, proves that the applicants have not made 
  a full disclosure and if that is based entirely on the fact that there is a 
  difference in his version, from the applicant's version, that difference is 
  on the matters of detail, you know. That doesn't throw any light on whether 
  the event occurred or not, it is just on a matter of detail and that difference 
  might be an honest difference of memory, recollection of events and so on.ADV 
  ARENDSE: We are perfectly happy to leave it on that basis. Mr Smith, at 
  the time in 1993, we were still being ruled by a White minority, you accept 
  that?MR SMITH: I do agree.ADV ARENDSE: And political organisations 
  had different agendas? Do you accept that? In terms of what they wanted and 
  what their vision for the future was?MR SMITH: At that time there was 
  a process of elections carrying on and I knew, you know, looking at the situation 
  the country is in, a change is going to come about.ADV ARENDSE: Yes, 
  I think it is well-known that there were talks at Kempton Park, I think you 
  are referring to that, those negotiations, not elections with respect, but there 
  were negotiations.MR SMITH: The negotiations, you know, with this you 
  feel that if that is taking place, why have the violence to back that up? You 
  can have a peaceful settlement through a different manner than violence. Wait 
  till after that, the outcome of that and if you see, you are not getting what 
  you actually standing for, then by all means, apply yourself to what you think 
  is fit, but in this manner, I don't see they could do that.ADV ARENDSE: 
  But do you accept as a fact that there were nevertheless organisations who differed 
  on the manner in which they are going to bring about change in this country? 
  There were some, just to narrow it down, there were some who believed that they 
  should do so through sitting around a table and there were others who believed 
  that they should do so through the barrel of a gun? MR SMITH: As I've 
  said before, I don't read the news, it is only what I hear from people and to 
  me, as I heard, there are people out there called APLA, whatever it is, that 
  were taking offence in that manner.ADV ARENDSE: So do you vaguely remember 
  that APLA was a militant organisation?MR SMITH: Man, to a certain extent 
  it can, it rings a bell vaguely there.ADV ARENDSE: Yes. The composition 
  of the church, the different nationalities you were referring to. Do you accept 
  that one couldn't expect the applicants here today to have known that?MR 
  SMITH: Normally, the people, as I've said before, we attended the church, 
  you find out, you familiarise yourself with one seat and you stick to that seat 
  and in the front rows, there were Blacks, outright Blacks, there is one person 
  sitting in the congregation this evening, that was sitting right in front, my 
  daughter was the last actually that was pulled down, and she is not fair and 
  you could see it from a distance and the guy that shot to that direction, the 
  guy right in front of me, if he couldn't see that, then I don't know, then he 
  didn't know what the distinction between White and Black is.ADV ARENDSE: 
  But I am talking about the composition, you told us about the Chinese and the 
  Russians.MR SMITH: There are Chinese and Russians that attend the church 
  as I said to you and outright you can actually see them.ADV ARENDSE: 
  You also said that this thing happened in a matter of seconds and it happened 
  very quickly.MR SMITH: I did.ADV ARENDSE: Do you accept that the 
  only basis that one can explain what happened that day, is that what was done 
  must have been done to achieve some political objective?MR SMITH: Man, 
  to me, sorry about the noise, I felt in my way, that they wanted to gain media 
  exposure and the only way they can do it, is to use a church.JUDGE WILSON: 
  Did they want to retrieve media exposure for their political purposes? MR 
  SMITH: As I said again to the APLA sort of reasoning, I wasn't aware of 
  what their reasoning and status was in this country, fighting the courses for, 
  because I never read the newspapers etc.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you very much 
  Mr Chairman, thank you Mr Smith.MR SMITH: Thank you.
  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE 
  CHAIRMAN: Any questions you wish to put?JUDGE NGOEPE: No, thank you.CHAIRMAN: 
  Any re-examination?RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV BEMBRIDGE: Just one question 
  Mr Chairman. May I just clarify with you Mr Smith. What you are saying is that, 
  or am I correct in summarising what you are saying to be that because the door 
  in the church stayed open, you assumed there was a third person holding the 
  door open?MR SMITH: That is right.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr 
  Chairman.
  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGECHAIRMAN: Thank you Mr Smith. MR 
  SMITH: I would like to thank the Judges for allowing me to give my testimony 
  before the time, but it is an unforeseen matter, thank you.CHAIRMAN: 
  Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: Cross-examining?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Mr Chairman, my learned friend has suggested, as he suggested 
  that I suggested that we take an adjournment at this stage until half past one, 
  I don't know what the Committee's attitude to that would be?ADV ARENDSE: 
  I won't say anything to you in confidence again.CHAIRMAN: It seems that 
  the Committee members generally are persuaded by your request. We will adjourn 
  until half past one.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. COMMITTEE 
  ADJOURNSON RESUMPTION - CHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge, you were about to commence 
  questioning of this applicant.
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Makoma, 
  when did you, you say you became a member of the Task Force or rather you became 
  - let me just clarify something. You became a member of the Task Force in 1993, 
  is that correct? MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When did you then 
  become a member of APLA?MR MAKOMA: I became a member of APLA when the 
  one who was a Task Force Commander was arrested. And it was investigated that 
  I was one of those who were suspected. Under those circumstances I had to align 
  myself with APLA members.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When did that take place though?MR 
  MAKOMA: In 1993.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Also in 1993? After you had joined 
  the Task Force already?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you remember 
  more or less what month of 1993 that was? Was it in the beginning of the year 
  or the middle of the year?MR MAKOMA: At the beginning of the year.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: How long after you had joined the Task Force was it that you 
  joined APLA?MR MAKOMA: It was not long after the Commander of the Task 
  Force was arrested. JUDGE WILSON: How long after you joined the Task 
  Force was the question, not how long after the Commander was arrested.CHAIRMAN: 
  Was it one month, two months?MR MAKOMA: It was only a month.
ADV BEMBRIDGE: Was it not very close to the attack, about a month or 
  so before the attack on the St James church that you joined APLA?MR MAKOMA: 
  No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Am I correct in saying it was when Vusi approached 
  you that you in fact joined APLA?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Is it not correct that he only approached you some three or four weeks prior 
  to the attack on the St James church?MR MAKOMA: No, that is not true.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Is it correct that at some stage you left home with your parents, 
  and you went to live with somebody else, another lady in Site C?MR MAKOMA: 
  Will you please repeat your question?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is it correct that 
  you at some stage left your parents' home and went to live with another woman, 
  another lady in Site C in Khayelitsha, because you thought your parents would 
  force you to go back to school, which you didn't want to do? MR MAKOMA: 
  Are you asking whether that is true or not?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am asking 
  if that is true?MR MAKOMA: No, that is not true.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  How did you come to meet Vusi?MR MAKOMA: I met Vusi through someone who 
  was from the PAC.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who was that person? The person whom 
  you met Vusi through?MR MAKOMA: It was Mhambi.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And 
  who was he in the PAC, what position did he hold?MR MAKOMA: He was in 
  the Regional Executive of the PAC.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Who is Mr Mkula?MR 
  MAKOMA: He is the Chairman of the PAC, in the Site B Branch.JUDGE WILSON: 
  Could you repeat the name please? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mkula?JUDGE WILSON: 
  Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Was it not at Mr Mkula's house that you met 
  Vusi for the first time?MR MAKOMA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did Vusi, 
  or is it correct to say that Vusi recruited you to APLA?MR MAKOMA: What 
  happened is this, when I heard that police are looking for me, the leader of 
  the PAC of the Region also heard that, they are the ones who asked me to meet 
  Vusi.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And how was it arranged that you would meet Vusi, 
  where did you meet him?MR MAKOMA: There was a rally in Guguletu, that 
  is where we met.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And who is Vusi in the PAC or in APLA?MR 
  MAKOMA: He is the Commander.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where is he now?MR 
  MAKOMA: I don't know. ADV BEMBRIDGE: When was the last time that 
  you saw him?MR MAKOMA: I last saw him about two or three months before 
  the attack, because he was supposed to go away. The only thing I knew he was 
  supposed to leave in a period of two to three months. And then Lester was going 
  to take over, Lester Sichomiso.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is Vusi's full name?MR 
  MAKOMA: In APLA we don't know each other by our full names, I know him as 
  Vusi.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How did your training - Vusi trained you in military 
  training, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: By the time I was still in the Task 
  Force group, as Bassie has said before, there were also APLA members who were 
  involved in the Task Force, but we knew nothing about them. We didn't know that 
  they were members of APLA, I was trained by them. Everything was organised by 
  the Commander of the Task Force. I was trained by them with my fellow Africans. 
  The ones that police were looking for.JUDGE WILSON: Could I go back for 
  a moment, I just want to make sure I've got the thing down. Did you say you 
  last saw Vusi two to three months before the attack?MR MAKOMA: The last 
  time I saw Vusi, it was before the attack, and he was supposed to leave in two 
  or three months time.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How long before the attack was it 
  that you last saw him though?MR MAKOMA: I can say a month before the 
  attack, or either three weeks, I am not really sure. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can 
  I just check that your previous answer was properly interpreted to me. Did you 
  say the last time you saw him, it was intended that he would leave three months 
  after that?MR MAKOMA: The only thing he told me is that he won't be in 
  the area for two to three months.ADV BEMBRIDGE: So he said he was going 
  away for two to three months, not going away in two to three months time? Is 
  that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes, that is what I was trying to say.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Now, you say that in the criminal trial in this matter, you were 
  not telling the truth to the court?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And you also said in the trial that you were assaulted and by that assault forced 
  into making statements, confessions, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Do you still say that you were assaulted in that manner and do 
  you still say that your statements were made because of an assault?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is your response to the Judge's finding that 
  you were laying when you said that?MR MAKOMA: Can you please repeat the 
  question? ADV BEMBRIDGE: What is your response to the Judge's finding 
  in the criminal trial that you were laying when you said you had been assaulted 
  and interrogated?MR MAKOMA: I've heard the Judge saying I am laying, 
  but I was facing a very difficult time at that moment so I couldn't bring in 
  front the evidence that I was tortured and beaten. I did hear him, but I tried 
  to show him that I was tortured. There was nothing I could do when he said I 
  was not beaten.ADV BEMBRIDGE: There was a long investigation at the trial 
  into whether you were beaten or not, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: I know 
  that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And you had an Advocate, Advocate Desai representing 
  you in that trial, is that also correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And you gave him instructions and you told him everything that had happened 
  to you and he put all that before the court, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Now, I am putting to you that the record of those 
  proceedings dealing only with the question of whether you were assaulted or 
  not, runs into almost 1 000 pages. At the end of that investigation, the Judge 
  still found that you were telling lies when you said that you were assaulted. 
  Do you still insist that you were assaulted in interrogation?MR MAKOMA:	
  Yes. ADV BEMBRIDGE: You see if the Judge after that long investigation 
  which I have described and after you say your Advocate put your story to the 
  court, if he found that you were laying, then how are we to believe otherwise 
  today?CHAIRMAN: He is telling you that he disagrees with what the Judge 
  found. That is what the essence of his evidence was.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr 
  Chairman, I felt it necessary however, to give him that opportunity, since it 
  will clearly be for me to argue that if the Judge found that, then we should 
  similarly found that.CHAIRMAN: You can argue that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Well, I thought I should merely give him an opportunity to comment on that argument.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: It will be a very interesting argument. Just because somebody else 
  disbelieved him, we must disbelieve him?ADV BEMBRIDGE: You made two statements 
  to the police, is that not so Mr Makoma? You made one ...MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You made one to Detective Segal on the 14th of August and then 
  you made one to Major Lester on the 15th of August?MR MAKOMA: Those that 
  were taken to the court were the only two, but I've made many statements, more 
  than two.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is it not so that the statement you made on the 
  14th of August is very much the same as the statement you made on the 15th of 
  August?MR MAKOMA: Can you please repeat your question? ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Is it not correct that the statement you made on the 14th of August, is the 
  same or very much the same, as the one you made on the 15th of August?MR 
  MAKOMA: Whether they do look similar or not, the only thing I know is that 
  I was forced to make those statements.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Now, if we look 
  at your statement that you made on the 14th of August, in that statement you 
  say that two weeks before the attack on St James, you saw Vusi at a taxi rank 
  in Site C, that he told you that he was going to Kenilworth, that he told you 
  that he used to go to a restaurant there, but that on this occasion he was going 
  there to find a place to attack? Why did you say that?MR MAKOMA: I will 
  answer your question. It is because I was tortured, that is why I made that 
  statement. If you still continue asking those questions, I won't have to answer 
  those because the torture effected me badly. If you still continue, you will 
  make me rude.INTERPRETER: If I may interject there Mr Chairman, the interpretation 
  there was not exact. The applicant said that I will then find myself in a situation 
  where I say things that I did not mean to say, then the interpreter interpreted 
  that as rude, which is not quite the same.MS KHAMPEPE: In fact he says 
  I will say things that I wouldn't like to say.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But where 
  did you get this idea from that you had met Vusi at the taxi rank, where did 
  that come from, that idea?MR MAKOMA: I told you that police knew Vusi. 
  By the time I was arrested, I was facing some problems. The policemen said I 
  must agree with what they are telling me as they are telling me. Under different 
  circumstances, the way they were torturing me, so I had to make up some stories 
  like this one. The one you are saying they are statements.ADV DE JAGER: 
  Mr Makoma, you told us now that if counsel would continue to ask you questions, 
  you would tell us things that you wouldn't like to tell us. Is that correct?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes.ADV DE JAGER: Would that be the truth you will be telling 
  us? Would that be the truth that you are going to tell us, that you wouldn't 
  like to tell us?MR MAKOMA: What I am trying to clarify here or to bring 
  up, they didn't accept this in court. Political parties have informers. I was 
  not an experienced soldier, I had a problem when I met policemen who had full 
  information that some of them, I don't know. I was tortured, beaten, I couldn't 
  sleep, I was not eating. Under those circumstances I had to do many things so 
  that I can run away from this thing. Although the policemen didn't bring that 
  thing up or forward. I tried to kill myself, but they found that. I took the 
  gun from the police, not in the intention to kill them, but to kill myself because 
  I was in a very, very difficult situation.ADV DE JAGER: No, the only 
  thing I wanted to know, what is it that you would tell us that you didn't really 
  want to tell us, is that what you have related now? Did you refer to this?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, because this thing didn't even come up in court.ADV DE JAGER: 
  Thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Perhaps you can have a look at page 8 of the 
  bundle in front of you. If you have a look at the last paragraph on that page, 
  before it says signed G.C. Makoma, that paragraph, can you read and understand 
  that?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I've read that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: The description 
  of the attack that took place, as to how the attack happened, that is correct, 
  is it not? MR MAKOMA: The one here is not the truth.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Let me read to you the section. You went to the church it says.JUDGE NGOEPE: 
  ... those portions that you think you disagree with?MR MAKOMA: Sorry, 
  what page is that?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Page 8.MR MAKOMA: Where on page 
  8?ADV BEMBRIDGE: On the last paragraph before it says signed G.C. Makoma. 
  It starts .. then Vusi asked Aubrey ...MR MAKOMA: Okay, yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  That paragraph. Although you say that some of the names are wrong, that is how 
  the attack happened, is it not?MR MAKOMA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What 
  is incorrect there?MR MAKOMA: First of all Vusi's name is mentioned here 
  that he is involved, of which he was not there. ADV BEMBRIDGE: anything 
  else?MR MAKOMA: I am still looking, please wait for me. A Cressida is 
  mentioned here, there was no Cressida there.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Then after 
  that it goes on to say what had happened?MR MAKOMA: Again, we did not 
  go to Site B after this attack.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What I want to ask you 
  is if now, you had admitted to the police here that you had committed the attack, 
  why is it necessary for you to make up all these other things about the meeting 
  in Kenilworth and what Vusi told you about the attack when he met you in Kenilworth. 
  You've now confessed to being involved in the attack, the police would not surely 
  have forced you to say all this? This is something you made from your own head?MR 
  MAKOMA: I told you before - I don't know what you want me to say now.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: What more did the police want from you than the fact that you 
  had participated in the attack and that Vusi was in the attack?MR MAKOMA: 
  There were many things.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Like what?MR MAKOMA: They 
  wanted to know about the operation that happened in a restaurant in Claremont, 
  who attacked there, shooting of policemen in Guguletu of which I know nothing 
  about that. And who did that, they had information that I was also involved. 
  And as the Commander of the Task Force was arrested, the Commander told them 
  I am the one who is responsible for the ammunition. I did keep the arms. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Then, now you say you knew nothing about the attack on the policemen 
  in Guguletu, but you knew something about the attack in Claremont? I don't say 
  you were part of it, but you knew something of it?MR MAKOMA: Who told 
  you that?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am asking you if that is so?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, I didn't say that. I am telling you that I was asked things that I know 
  nothing about.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Well you said you knew nothing about the 
  Guguletu attack, you specifically said that, you didn't say you knew nothing 
  about the Claremont attack.MR MAKOMA: Maybe you didn't hear me or there 
  was no right interpretation because I told you that I know nothing about these 
  things.CHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge, was this statement used during the trial?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: As Judge Wilson correctly pointed out, there was no decision 
  on this statement during the trial, it was the other statement which was submitted 
  and therefore rejected during the trial.CHAIRMAN: Was this one used in 
  whatever way, was it used at all?ADV BEMBRIDGE: I don't believe it was 
  used, no.CHAIRMAN: And if it, well you haven't established that whether 
  it was used? ADV BEMBRIDGE: No evidence was led on the statements at 
  the trial.CHAIRMAN: You don't know why it was not used?ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  It may have been that the Prosecution expected similar difficulties. I don't 
  know. I cannot comment for the State Prosecution at that stage.CHAIRMAN: 
  It may even be that they accepted his possible argument that he was assaulted 
  into it.ADV BEMBRIDGE: They clearly rejected, or the Judge clearly rejected 
  any suggestion that he had been assaulted in interrogation.CHAIRMAN: 
  Any way, we don't know why it wasn't used. That is what I am trying to find 
  out.JUDGE WILSON: It was mentioned but not used, at page 47 of the record, 
  after having referred to the questioning, prolonged questioning of the accused, 
  the Judge there says the accused then capitulated, wrote a lengthy statement 
  for Segal and agreed to point out things at the scene of the crime the next 
  day, top of page 47. He then agreed to point things out and he said that he 
  had been compelled to do so because he had been assaulted by the police.CHAIRMAN: 
  You can proceed.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. You see, it seems 
  clear to me from this statement, that you were well informed about what the 
  target of the attack was and that you knew it was a church in Kenilworth and 
  that when you and the other applicants say you had no idea of the target of 
  the attack, you were not telling the entire truth.MR MAKOMA: We are here 
  to tell the truth, so I don't know what you want us to say.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You refer in paragraph 6 of your affidavit to an attack at a house in Macassar. 
  I beg your pardon Mr Chairman, I misunderstood the context in which it is written. 
  CHAIRMAN: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where did you get the 9 mm pistol 
  that you gave to Mlambisa for his protection?MR MAKOMA: It was one of 
  the weapons that was left by Lester.CHAIRMAN: By what?MR MAKOMA: 
  Lester, one of the guns that were left by Lester with me.ADV BEMBRIDGE:	
  When did he leave it with you?MR MAKOMA: It was his own gun. After Vusi 
  left, we used to meet time and again and he gave me this rifle.INTERPRETER:	
  The speaker's microphone is not on.JUDGE WILSON: What other guns did 
  he give you?MR MAKOMA: R4 rifle, but it was not used on the attack.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Do you know where he got these weapons from?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, I don't know. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where did he keep them, where did he 
  get them from to give to you?MR MAKOMA: I don't know. I just accepted 
  the one that he gave me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where were you when he gave it 
  to you? Where were you when he gave it to you?MR MAKOMA: Where he was 
  staying.ADV BEMBRIDGE: In his house?MR MAKOMA: It was not his 
  house, it was one of the fellow Africans' house.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Now, you 
  say you were told by Vusi that there would be an operation?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When was it that he told you this?MR MAKOMA: 
  Before Lester arrived.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What did he tell you about the operation?MR 
  MAKOMA: He just told me that there was going to be an operation, nothing 
  further than that. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why did he just say that - in what 
  conversation did it come up that there would be an operation?MR MAKOMA: 
  I can't tell you, he is the only one who knows, but he told me about the operation.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Did he tell you, you were going to be involved in the operation?MR 
  MAKOMA: No, he didn't.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why then do you say in paragraph 
  7 of your affidavit, that you knew there was going to be an attack?MR MAKOMA: 
  On that question, if you mean why, are you really meaning why?JUDGE WILSON:	
  What was the question? Why did you not say in your affidavit you knew there 
  was going to be an attack?ADV BEMBRIDGE: No, why did he say in the affidavit 
  he knew there was going to be an attack?CHAIRMAN: Didn't he say that 
  he was told by Vusi that there was going to be an attack?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  He said there would be an operation.CHAIRMAN: Maybe that is a difference 
  in words rather.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I submit, a significant one. CHAIRMAN:	
  Make your point then.JUDGE NGOEPE: Let's look at that. Are you referring 
  to paragraph 7 ?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Yes.JUDGE NGOEPE: You say why did 
  he say that ...?ADV BEMBRIDGE: There was going to be an attack.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: If what?ADV BEMBRIDGE: If all he had been told is that there 
  was going to be an operation. How did he know that the operation ...JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Did you read paragraph 7, did you read the preceding sentences?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Yes. My understanding from all the applicants is that all that 
  they knew is that there would be an operation, that they had no further details.JUDGE 
  NGOEPE: Was Vusi there on the day? On this day, on the Sunday, the 25th?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: It appears not.JUDGE NGOEPE: Well, you asked him whether 
  Vusi did tell him as to what was going to happen? Whether there was going to 
  be an operation, which was apparently on a different day, some days before the 
  25th? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Certainly, but his evidence is that right up until 
  the time of the attack itself, they didn't know the operation or what the nature 
  of the operation was. Now he says that prior to the time, he knew that there 
  was to be an attack.JUDGE WILSON: Well, what do you think operation means?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: It could have been anything with respect Mr Wilson.CHAIRMAN: 
  Certainly.JUDGE WILSON: When he says I was made aware by Vusi that there 
  would be an operation, but at that time the target was unknown to me, doesn't 
  that only mean an attack? An operation where the target is unknown?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Well, clearly then, that is my suggestion, that they were then given more details 
  than merely that there was an operation.MS KHAMPEPE: Mr Bembridge, I 
  must say in Xhosa an operation is an attack. I think you will have to phrase 
  your question in such a way that you make it quite clear to Mr Makoma that you 
  want far much more than what has been put in the interpretation.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  With respect, it is the applicant who makes the distinction in his affidavit, 
  not I.CHAIRMAN: Yes, this is in the English language, it is done through 
  interpreters and I think that you must concede that the word operation and attack 
  can be read as if they were synonymous, but I don't know whether there is anything 
  material that turns on it. You wanted to know precisely whether he knew where 
  the operation was going to be or where the attack was going to be and he said 
  he didn't know. So he didn't know where the operation was going to be or what 
  it was, he didn't know where the attack was going to be. You are saying that 
  he knew about it, that is the point you are trying to make, isn't it?ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: He knew more than that it was merely an operation. CHAIRMAN: 
  What could be more?ADV BEMBRIDGE: It could be anything, it could be ...CHAIRMAN: 
  Such as?ADV BEMBRIDGE: At attempt, a bank robbery for funds for the organisation, 
  an apprehension of an informer, an exercise in defense of the party.CHAIRMAN: 
  Well, it depends upon how he understood the word operation at that time.ADV 
  DE JAGER: If you have known two weeks before that there would have been 
  an attack on the church, and that you would be attacking Whites, would you have 
  participated or not?MR MAKOMA: When we have told something, they were 
  not going to ask for permission from you. They were just giving orders. You 
  don't have to oppose or ask any questions up until they tell you this is the 
  right time to do that.ADV DE JAGER: Yes, and if you were ordered, you 
  would have carried out the orders? Is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV 
  DE JAGER: And if they ordered you a month before the time that you should 
  go and attack a church, you would have gone? You wouldn't have disobeyed their 
  order?MR MAKOMA: I would have gone there.ADV DE JAGER: Yes. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Would you have gone if you had known that the church would be 
  half full of non-settlers, if I can put it that way?MR MAKOMA: An order 
  is an order. You don't think who is there and who is not there. If an order 
  is being instructed, you just do that.MS KHAMPEPE: Mr Makoma, were operatives 
  in your unit ever involved in the actual identification of targets?MR MAKOMA: 
  No, it was only the Commander who used to do that.JUDGE WILSON: Had you 
  been involved in any APLA operation attack before this?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: On that occasion, had you been told what the target was before 
  the attack?MR MAKOMA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: After the attack, you 
  say you went to a house in Ottery. MR MAKOMA: Yes, we went to a nearby 
  house, then I didn't know that it was Aubrey.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Whose house 
  was it?MR MAKOMA: I don't know. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Did you see the 
  people there the next day who owned the house?MR MAKOMA: No.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Who was in the house the next day?MR MAKOMA: It was me and my colleague 
  next to me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What happened to the weapons after the attack?MR 
  MAKOMA: When we arrived at night, the weapons were taken and put back into 
  the bag and I went to sleep. The following day I woke up, Lester left and Bassie 
  left and then we were told that we will be leaving in the afternoon. I don't 
  know what happened to the arms, maybe we left them in the house, I don't know.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You say in paragraph 13 of your affidavit that it is now obvious 
  to you that Vusi and Nonxuba had known of the operation for some time. Why is 
  that obvious now?MR MAKOMA: They were the Commanders, both of them. We 
  were soldiers.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why is it only obvious now though, why was 
  it not obvious before the attack? If you have a look at paragraph 13 in the 
  last sentence, it is now obvious however, that Vusi and Nonxuba had known of 
  the operation for some time. Why is that only obvious now, why did you not realise 
  that before the attack took place?MR MAKOMA: The name obvious that is 
  written there, maybe it is the English that I don't understand, but what I know 
  is the Commanders are the only ones who are supposed to know. Because if they 
  didn't know, there was no attack that is going to happen. ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  When you were arrested, you were arrested with a bag, is that correct?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What were the contents of that bag?MR 
  MAKOMA: There were books, a diary, a bullet and the cleaning equipment for 
  the guns and my jersey.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Cleaning equipment for which guns?MR 
  MAKOMA: I mean guns?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Any guns?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: And where did you get the bag from?MR MAKOMA: Vusi left 
  the bag with me.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Before he left?MR MAKOMA: Yes. 
  And then I was supposed to take that bag to Lester. And he said I must keep 
  it for a while. By the time I was arrested I had this bag with me, taking it 
  to Lester. ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why were you taking it to Lester at that time?MR 
  MAKOMA: Because he told me to do so.ADV BEMBRIDGE: When did he tell 
  you that?CHAIRMAN: Why were you taking it at that time and not some other 
  time, is that the point?ADV BEMBRIDGE: That is correct.CHAIRMAN: 
  Why on that particular day were you taking it to Lester?MR MAKOMA: It 
  is because Lester told me that the following day I must bring the bag.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: The day following what?MR MAKOMA: Before the day I was 
  arrested.ADV BEMBRIDGE: So you were in contact with Lester the day before 
  you were arrested?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Why was that? 
  MR MAKOMA: Because I was the one who knows where Lester stays.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: What did you have to contact him about though?MR MAKOMA: 
  As my Commander I was supposed to go and see him.ADV BEMBRIDGE: For what 
  purpose?MR MAKOMA: For messages, maybe I would have taken and give to 
  other colleagues of us.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What did you think the attack would 
  achieve?MR MAKOMA: Can you please clarify your question?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  What did you think would be achieved by the attack?MR MAKOMA: The attack 
  was done under the Commander of APLA, and APLA was fighting the armed struggle. 
  It was fighting for the land of the Blacks that were taken from them with force 
  by the Whites and that was the duty of APLA to fight for the land to come back, 
  using armed struggle, that is what it was formed for.ADV BEMBRIDGE: How 
  would this attack help the land to come back?MR MAKOMA: The struggle 
  that was going on in this country, as the African nation was the struggle to 
  the oppressors. When we see them, we see White people. They were the minority 
  that was ruling. The power they had were using them to oppress the Africans. 
  They were in a war with us as Africans although we were unarmed, the way they 
  were armed. APLA then was fighting returning a bullet with a bullet, protecting 
  the Africans in Azania and the PAC was busy using other tactics, so that you 
  people in the government could hear the cries of the children of Azania. If 
  your ears couldn't listen, APLA decided to take guns to open the ears that were 
  not prepared to listen.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But is it not so Mr Makoma that 
  the very time you did that, there was a special meeting of all the parties arranged 
  in Johannesburg to specially provide that all the ears of everybody would be 
  opened to hear what the PAC and everyone else had to say, at the very time you 
  committed this attack?MR MAKOMA: I know that, but APLA as the military 
  wing of the PAC never had an instruction from the political leadership of PAC 
  not to use the arms, that is why soldiers of APLA were still busy fighting and 
  shooting.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You heard earlier the press statements that we 
  read out and the newspaper reports which said that the PAC denied any responsibility 
  for the act, that they condemn the act, that APLA denied any responsibility 
  for the act. You heard the statement of Mr Desai who said that he condemned 
  the act, you heard APLA saying it was not the kind of operation that they would 
  authorise. On what basis then do you say it was in the furtherance of APLA's 
  policies that you committed this attack?MR MAKOMA: The attack was led 
  by one of the High Command members of APLA. One of the big high profile members 
  of APLA who were giving instructions to the soldiers.ADV BEMBRIDGE: If 
  that is so, then why did this APLA spokesperson in Dar Es Salaam say they had 
  no responsibility for the attack?MR MAKOMA: Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, 
  when there is a call to South Africa and when someone is calling him or herself 
  as a member of APLA, and then that person does not identify him or herself clearly, 
  and then we were supposed to take that instruction. And we would say it is from 
  APLA and yet, it is from the media or the papers, not from APLA.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  You knew when you went into that church that there would be many people inside 
  and that what you did would kill many people and injure many people? Is that 
  so?MR MAKOMA: Are you saying when I was going there I - is it I knew 
  that there was going to be many people because I have told you that I didn't 
  know. Maybe you can ask whether did I see that there were many people, because 
  I knew nothing before that. ADV BEMBRIDGE: As Judge Wilson said earlier, 
  you saw there were lots of cars parked outside for one, so there must have been 
  many people? You saw when you went inside that there were many people?MR 
  MAKOMA: Yes, inside.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And for what purpose was it necessary 
  to glue nails onto the handgrenades?MR MAKOMA: The weapons that were 
  used there, I was seeing them for the very first time and I never put any nails. 
  If who took them there and who put the nails there, I don't know.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  But you knew when you threw that handgrenade that there were nails glued to 
  it?MR MAKOMA: Yes, I saw them that there were nails glued, but the order 
  said I must throw it while it is glued.ADV BEMBRIDGE: You have been to 
  church yourself, is that correct?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And you know that the church is a place of sanctuary and a place where people 
  pray?MR MAKOMA: Yes.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Do you not think that something 
  else would have been a better target than a church? MR MAKOMA: If I was 
  in the position of choosing the target, I would have thought that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you Mr Chairman.
  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGE
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink, are there any questions you wish to put?CROSS-EXAMINATION 
  BY MR BRINK: I just want to clear up one point, it won't be long. You said 
  earlier in your evidence that you met Vusi through a PAC Regional Executive 
  member?MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: Can you give me his name, I missed 
  it. The name of that Regional Executive member who introduced you to Vusi? MR 
  MAKOMA: It was Mhambi.MR BRINK: Can you spell it please?MR MAKOMA: 
  Mhambi.MR BRINK: Was that his code name or his real name?MR MAKOMA: 
  I won't know whether it was his real name or surname, that is all I know it 
  was Mr Mhambi. MR BRINK: That is the only name you know?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes.MR BRINK: And of what region was he an Executive member or of which 
  region rather?MR MAKOMA: Western Cape region;MR BRINK: Western 
  Cape?MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: And is he still about, is he living 
  in the Western Cape, do you know?MR MAKOMA: No, I don't know whether 
  he is still here in the Western Cape or not.MR BRINK: So you don't know 
  where he lives?MR MAKOMA: I know he stayed here in Cape Town, but I don't 
  know where exactly.
  MR BRINK: All right. Finally, just to refer you to page 5 of the bundle 
  Mr Makoma, I beg your pardon, page 6 of the bundle. The first sentence was read 
  out to you and you said some of it is incorrect and some may have been correct. 
  It is correct that at the time of the attack, you were a standard 8 schoolboy? 
  MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: That was correct? But you say it is not 
  correct when you said that you were not a member of APLA or the military wing 
  of any other organisation?MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: That wasn't 
  correct. But it is correct, isn't it, that it was not the policy of the PAC 
  to perpetrate such attacks?MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: That is correct?MR 
  MAKOMA: It is correct.MR BRINK: You see what I don't really understand 
  is that APLA is part and parcel of the PAC, I know it is the military wing, 
  but it is the same organisation, isn't it? The PAC is the umbrella organisation 
  and it have the junior branches and the military wing?MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR 
  BRINK: Would not APLA Commanders have received instructions from the leadership 
  of the PAC not to perpetrate acts of this sort in the light of the fact that 
  negotiations were proceeding at Kempton Park?MR MAKOMA: Will you please 
  repeat your question?MR BRINK: APLA was part and parcel of the PAC, is 
  that correct? MR MAKOMA: Yes.MR BRINK: Now I understand that you 
  were merely a soldier and not an activist in the PAC as such, but what I find 
  hard to understand and maybe you can help me, how it came about that the PAC 
  which was involved in peace negotiations at the time of this attack, had not 
  told APLA leadership not to do this sort of thing. Do you understand?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes, I understand.MR BRINK: Are you able to comment?MR MAKOMA: 
  Yes, I can make a comment. APLA had powers to go on with the armed struggle 
  from the Congress that was held by the region of the PAC of South Africa. As 
  long as the Congress that didn't hold another meeting to tell the soldiers not 
  to attack, orders were still going on on the ground that we must continue attacking 
  up until the leadership could call another Congress and then the members of 
  the PAC of all the regions, would take a decision that APLA must stop the armed 
  struggle. And then APLA would stop. Because the leader is a political leadership 
  which is PAC, the mother body.MR BRINK: Thank you.MR MAKOMA: Thank 
  you. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINKCHAIRMAN: Any re-examination?

  EXCUSED
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Arendse, do you propose calling any other evidence?ADV ARENDSE: 
  No, Mr Chairman, that is the case for the applicants, thank you.CHAIRMAN: 
  Mr Bembridge?ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you Mr Chairman. We would like to call 
  Mr Ackerman. He has asked me to request Mr Chairman that we just have a very 
  short recess if possible, just a few moments for me to speak to him.CHAIRMAN: 
  Very well, we will take a very, very short recess.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank 
  you Mr Chairman. COMMISSION TAKES A SHORT ADJOURNMENT
  ON RESUMPTION - CHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge? ADV BEMBRIDGE: Thank you 
  for the opportunity Mr Chairman, we would then like to call Mr Dawie Ackerman.CHAIRMAN: 
  What are your full names, Mr Ackerman?MR ACKERMAN: Dawid Jakobus Ackerman. 
  DAWID JAKOBUS ACKERMAN: (sworn states)EXAMINATION BY ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Ackerman, you are a parishioner at the St James church 
  in Kenilworth, is that correct?MR ACKERMAN: That is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  What is the denomination if one may term it that of that church?MR ACKERMAN: 
  It is the Church of England in South Africa.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And what if 
  you could just give some more detail perhaps, is the make-up of that congregation 
  there?MR ACKERMAN: It is a congregation of born again Christians and 
  visitors who come to the church who hopefully will accept the gospel of the 
  Lord Jesus Christ and become Christians.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Now, I understand 
  that you have people attending the church who live outside the area of Kenilworth 
  itself?MR ACKERMAN: That is correct. ADV BEMBRIDGE: What type 
  of people are those?MR ACKERMAN: They come from all sectors of the community. 
  They are - we are predominantly a family church, where families come to worship. 
  Families meaning mothers, fathers, children and children of all ages.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I understand also that there are people of all race groups who 
  attend that church?MR ACKERMAN: That is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  And I put it to you the applicants earlier that there is a percentage of almost 
  50 percent or around 40 percent of people who attend the church, who are not 
  in fact considered White?MR ACKERMAN: At this point in time I would say 
  that is a close percentage, I don't have the exact figures, but just by casting 
  one's eye over the congregation today I would say that it is very close to 50-50.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: And at the time of the attack?MR ACKERMAN: I would say 
  it was about 35 - 40 percent people of colour and the others so-called Whites.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: And was this on a regular basis that that would be the make-up?MR 
  ACKERMAN: Yes, that is correct.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What other people did 
  you have attending the church, I understand you get certain missions to the 
  ...MR ACKERMAN: That is correct, we have a mission outreach to visiting 
  Seamen in our port, we worked very closely at the time with another missionary 
  organisation called Biblia and together with them, we concentrated on visitors 
  in the harbour, Seamen and Russians, Filipino's, Chinese, Koreans, were brought 
  to our church. ADV BEMBRIDGE: And are these people also in regular attendance 
  there?MR ACKERMAN: The most regular is the Russian, that happens just 
  about every week, depending upon whether there are ships in the harbour, the 
  other Filipino's and Koreans and so on, that fluctuates with the work of Biblia, 
  but not so weekly regular, but I would say regular in terms of every few weeks.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I understand that on the evening of the attack, there were a 
  number of Russian people in the church and that there were in fact a couple 
  of hundred or two hundred or so?MR ACKERMAN: On the night of the attack, 
  there was about 125, in the immediate weeks before that, there was a crew change 
  taking place and we had up too 350 to 400 visitors about two weeks prior to 
  the attack.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I understand that the church also does missionary 
  work in the poorer sections of the Western Cape community, can you perhaps elaborate 
  a little bit on that?MR ACKERMAN: We have had since the mid 1980's an 
  outreach to Khayelitsha, to Site C, that is to the Black community, we also 
  in the old apartheid era had outreaches to other so-called Coloured areas where 
  we established daughter-churches, some of them became constituent sister-churches 
  and became independent from our help and became self-sufficient churches. We 
  never saw them in any other context but as Christian churches and they happened 
  to be in areas which were disadvantaged and we were fully aware of that and 
  our outreach to them in the first instance, was for the gospel, but we realised 
  too that you can't reach out to these areas without having a social obligation 
  also.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And how did you go about fulfilling that social obligation?MR 
  ACKERMAN: In the Khayelitsha outreach, we commenced by established a creche 
  facility during the week. The same hall was used on Sundays for services. During 
  the week also we provided sewing classes at that facility for the women of the 
  area.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And I understand that you had two affiliated churches 
  in the Khayelitsha area?MR ACKERMAN: At that stage we had one, we now 
  have a daughter-church in Mandela Park. At that stage already we had the ground, 
  but through lack of funds we hadn't yet been able to start the building work. 
  Building work has commenced recently and in fact I think it must be completed 
  by now. And that is in Mandela Park and that is a more permanent feature. Nothing 
  in Site C can be permanent, you are only allowed to erect timber and iron or 
  shack type of dwellings there. Excuse me, could I have some water please, thank 
  you. Please carry on. ADV BEMBRIDGE: I understand also that there was 
  some interchange between the churches and that people from the various churches 
  attended services at the other churches forming part of the St James group if 
  we can term it that?MR ACKERMAN: That is quite correct, we regularly, 
  every Sunday people from our church would go out to Khayelitsha to participate 
  in the services that were being held there. And similarly from time to time, 
  we would bring the parishioners or the children from the Khayelitsha outreach 
  to our church to expose our people to them again.CHAIRMAN: Sorry Mr Ackerman, 
  can I just ask you, this church is it situated in what at some stage in our 
  history would have been described as a White area?MR ACKERMAN: The St 
  James church?CHAIRMAN: Yes.MR ACKERMAN: Yes, I would say that 
  would be a factual position at one stage.CHAIRMAN: And you say now the 
  composition is 50-50 and at the time of the incident it was about 35/40 percent 
  people of colour?MR ACKERMAN: Correct.CHAIRMAN: And if I keep 
  on going back, it seems to me the percentage would be less and less, am I right?MR 
  ACKERMAN: Well, let me answer it to you like this. The church started in 
  about 1968/1969 with five children. I was not there at the time. I can't answer 
  for that. But certainly when I joined the church in 1979, they were already 
  a mixed church, but certainly the percentage was not anywhere near 35 percent 
  at the time, it was probably in the vicinity of about 10 percent people of colour 
  in 1979. The church does not have borders, it is not a church with a predetermined 
  border that says this is the church for Kenilworth, Wynberg, we were always 
  a church without borders and attracting people that were interested to hear 
  the gospel. Friends brought friends.CHAIRMAN: I appreciate that, but 
  my question then is, if I were to ask you whether going back with history with 
  50 percent, 35 percent and I keep on going back, if I were to ask you was there 
  a time when it was 100 percent White, you wouldn't not be able to answer that 
  question?MR ACKERMAN: That is correct, I wouldn't, I wasn't there.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Would it be correct also to say Mr Ackerman, that it was to some 
  extent by reason of the application of the Group Areas Act that in the past 
  more people of colour could not attend the church?MR ACKERMAN: No.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: You would not say that?MR ACKERMAN: No. No, our church 
  was always open, we never had any - from what I understand from our leadership, 
  that prior to me joining, that there was never any discrimination practised. 
  I understand at the time too, and it is a very dark time of our history, that 
  there was still an area close by to the St James church, which was a so-called 
  Coloured area and I think it would be reasonable to suppose, although I can't 
  say for sure, that some of those people might well have attended St James church. 
  But that would be conjecture from my side.ADV BEMBRIDGE: But there was 
  never any church policy contrary to that?MR ACKERMAN: In fact the church 
  policy was that of being open.ADV BEMBRIDGE: And that was from day one?MR 
  ACKERMAN: From day one. That is what Mr - Judge if I may be permitted to 
  add, that is one of the considerations when I became a Christian that attracted 
  me to this particular congregation, I came from an Afrikaans background, I attended 
  the Dutch Reformed Church and I was unhappy with the political connection of 
  the Dutch Reformed Church and that was part of my motivation to go to this particular 
  church.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Now, you say or I understand that there was about 
  1 300 people in the church that evening? MR ACKERMAN: Approximately.ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: And what sort of age groups was it made up of?MR ACKERMAN: 
  All age groups from - in the evenings children as young as six years old would 
  come to church. We don't provide creche facilities in the evening, so approximately 
  age five, six years old, right up to 80 and plus where they are still alive, 
  it is customary that the children would leave at the commencement of the service 
  after the singing of the first hymn or during that time, to a childrens' programme. 
  Children up to the age of about 12 years old.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Would you 
  describe it largely as a family service then, would that be accurate or not?MR 
  ACKERMAN: The evenings is always a gospel outreach service, where we preach 
  the message of salvation of Jesus Christ as the Son of God.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Did you, Mr Ackerman, have forewarning of the attack in the sense of seeing 
  anyone reconnoitre the church previous to it?MR ACKERMAN: No, I have 
  no knowledge of that.ADV BEMBRIDGE: No knowledge of that? Could you describe 
  the attack itself?MR ACKERMAN: Almost halfway through the service, the 
  last song item was taking place before the main preaching of the Word was going 
  to take place, and almost at the end of the song item, the door burst open and 
  I saw two gunmen, or two people come in, it all happened very quickly. I saw 
  and heard shots being fired. I saw a grenade flying through the air and I - 
  it was at that point that I ducked down together with the other people in my 
  pew.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Where was your wife at that time? MR ACKERMAN: 
  My wife was sitting right at the door where the perpetrators burst in. We were 
  sitting separate from one another because of the large contingent of Russians 
  in order to spread ourselves amongst them, I did not mention that my wife and 
  I actually headed up the outreach ministry to the Russians. We started it by 
  the grace of God.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was the reaction of the congregation 
  to the attack?MR ACKERMAN: Immediately at the time?ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  At the time of the attack?MR ACKERMAN: Well, the immediate, as the attack 
  was progressing was horror. My ears were zinging from the gunshots and then 
  especially from the two grenade explosions. I was afraid. I had visions of the 
  attackers walking up the isle and shooting the people between the benches as 
  they were laying down. My concern was for my wife and my one son who was in 
  the service. I knew my wife was sitting at the entrance. One part of me thought 
  she can't escape, another part of me hoped that she had escaped. The attack 
  certainly did not last more than a minute. When I got up and people, there were 
  people screaming, but immediately after the attack, it was as if a deathly silence, 
  apart from a few screams and groans here and there, settled on the church. And 
  it was like a whoosh as the people went for the exit doors. I went forward to 
  my wife, saw her still sitting upright. I thought that she might have survived, 
  but she had not.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I take it that the injuries that you saw 
  around you at the time, were quite horrific?MR ACKERMAN: It was very 
  horrific. Three benches in front of me the second handgrenade had landed and 
  it had blown the whole bench apart. And I saw Dimitri Makogon laying there, 
  as I now knew it was Dimitri. He was a bloody mess. I can't remember now that 
  I actually saw his legs blown off, but it was just blood everywhere, so it was 
  difficult to - and then my attention was more focused to my wife. In walking 
  towards her, I had to step over the dead bodies of Russians, I knew them, I 
  could identify them as Russians by their clothing and also by where they were 
  sitting. One had his head blown open and blood was oozing out on the carpet 
  from his head wound. Others were mutilatedly shot and were either dying or were 
  dead already. There were about three bodies that I stepped over to reach my 
  wife. ADV BEMBRIDGE: And there were, I understand, all people of all 
  ages and all race groups ... (tape ends) ... and were wounded in the attack?MR 
  ACKERMAN: Well all age groups, children 12 and older, because the under 
  12's had left the service, but yes, there were children. Mr & Mrs Harker's 
  two boys, they are in their early teens, there was another teenager, the son 
  of a Pastor, Richard O'Keele, he was about 17 and then people like my own wife 
  was 45, I think at the time.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What, or can you say what 
  it was that actually stopped the attack?MR ACKERMAN: At that stage, I 
  didn't know. I only learnt afterwards that someone had returned fire and that 
  this had caused them to flee.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Can you describe the effect 
  of the attack on you yourself personally?MR ACKERMAN: I think in a short 
  sentence, it has devastated my life. Immediately after the attack and after 
  I had taken my wife to the hospital and where she died about 20 minutes later, 
  I returned to the church in search of my children and was reunited with all 
  of them there. The more longer term effect of the incident has devastated me 
  in the following way in as much as I soon after that event, went into depression 
  which I did not recognise. It caused me to become progressively more unfunctional 
  in my work, in my ability to show emotion. I was diagnosed as suffering from 
  anxiety depression about a year later after I was already suicidal. I was hiding 
  it, I was in a leadership position at the time of the attack. I had resigned 
  from these leadership positions because I just felt I was not capable of performing 
  them.And I was not getting help and I was hiding the fact that I was suffering 
  from anxiety depression at that stage. In fact I didn't believe that I had it. 
  It was only when I consulted a Doctor that he diagnosed me as such, that I confided 
  in my Pastor and also in my employer of my true condition. I was placed on medication, 
  it did not have a good effect on me and I stopped taking the medication. I instead 
  sought counselling, Christian counselling. I also confided in my Chairman at 
  work, where he on a continual basis monitored me and my ability to work. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: I understand that you have since lost your employment as a result 
  of the trauma you've suffered?MR ACKERMAN: That is correct. That is correct. 
  My condition deteriorated. The position that I held was that of Secretary of 
  an Industrial Council, now known as a Bargaining Council for the clothing industry. 
  It is a very demanding position. There were tremendous changes taking place 
  in South Africa, it was the forum where the Unions and the employers would meet 
  to negotiate. It was the forum where one of the most, the third largest Union 
  in the COSATU fold, being SATU, came to do their negotiating business and with 
  all the demands of the new South Africa, the changing-over, the democratisation 
  process, the establishment of new health benefits and new Provident Benefits, 
  it was a tremendous workload that I was in charge of and in the end I was unable 
  to fulfil these tasks.ADV BEMBRIDGE: What was the effect on your family?MR 
  ACKERMAN: Because of my emotional, not only because of my emotional stumping, 
  but certainly my emotions had been stumped, I find it impossible to be angry 
  with them. I should have anger, but I am not. I instead I am angry with my own 
  family members. It is very difficult for me to say this, but I have a need to 
  say it. I want them to hear it. I fight more with my children now than what 
  I ever had before, and we fight about stupid things. I have never cried over 
  the death of my wife other than have silent cries, but I have never had an emotional 
  crying outburst. While Mr Makoma was testifying and he talked about his tortures 
  and that he was suicidal, I could identify with that. I thought to myself and 
  I wrote you a note to bring your cross-examination to an end, because what are 
  we doing here? The truth yes, but I looked at the way in which he answered you 
  and his anger. How on earth are we going to be reconciled? May I add one thing? 
  I am sorry, while it is in my mind now. I went on record after the event to 
  say that I hold no personal grudge, that I do not hate them and I stand by that. 
  I also held out reconciliation to them, and I believe with all my heart because 
  I've experienced reconciliation with God, through Jesus Christ, that it is available 
  to everybody, including to them. And I held that out to them at the time and 
  I still do so now.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Perhaps leading on from that Mr Ackerman, 
  what has been the church's reaction as a whole, to this attack and what effect 
  has it had on the church community itself?MR ACKERMAN: In the aftermath 
  of the attack, a super-natural calmness and presence was felt by our church, 
  we couldn't explain it. We just realised that this was of God. I understand 
  from Bishop Retief that international journalists came to him or a group of 
  journalists, including international, came to him and asked him please explain 
  to us what is going on here, why are you forgiving, why are you not filled with 
  rage and bitterness and he said that we have always told you that the Christian 
  message, the Christian gospel does have power, now you see it, now you are the 
  witnesses of it, report that. That is what in the aftermath of the attack, what 
  it was, what we experienced. It has not been easy, there has been hurts. There 
  had been people that have sort of reactions varied, people that couldn't return 
  to the church again, others that couldn't stay away. I for one couldn't stay 
  away from, in the immediate days following the massacre, to return to where 
  my wife had been shot down. It was a release to me to go there and to be where 
  she was killed. And as the time unfolded and the Truth Commission started up 
  and I heard the testimonies of my fellow Black South Africans, who had been 
  subjected to the treatment that they had and parents and mothers, brothers, 
  asked, telling where is my son, where is my father, and we know now that some 
  of them were buried in a farm somewhere in the Free State, some were thrown 
  in rivers in the Eastern Cape, because I know the value of going back to the 
  place where it happened, I appeal to the agents of the government, whoever they 
  might be, to come forward and to identify what they had done, where they did 
  it, at least give them also the opportunity to grieve where it happened. ADV 
  BEMBRIDGE: Would you like a moment Mr Ackerman?MR ACKERMAN: Yes, 
  please. Could my wife please pass me my jacket? I remarried two years ago. Thank 
  you Advocate.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Mr Ackerman, can you tell me, or tell the 
  Committee do you think that in the political climate and having regard to the 
  political developments that were going on at the time of the attack, that it 
  in fact achieved anything or it was an appropriate attack in the circumstances, 
  or justifiable in the circumstances?MR ACKERMAN: Mr Bembridge, it is 
  difficult for me to answer that because I am so subjectively close to the happening. 
  In retrospect I can see now that the apartheid government was an evil government, 
  that in some respects that the opposition to it was legitimate. I must tell 
  you that in my own personal opinion, I think that the gravity of the attack 
  and the fact that it was a defenceless church, people at worship, that I cannot 
  under any circumstances condone that in terms of an armed struggle and I must 
  stand with that answer.ADV BEMBRIDGE: Is there anything else you would 
  like to say to the Committee at this stage Mr Ackerman?MR ACKERMAN: Yes. 
  May I address the applicants? May I ask the applicants to turn around and to 
  face me? This is the first opportunity we've had to look each other in the eye 
  and talk. I want to ask Mr Makoma who actually entered the church - my wife 
  was sitting right at the door when we came in, where you came in, she was wearing 
  a long, blue coat, can you remember if you shot her?MR MAKOMA: I do remember 
  that I fired some shots, but I couldn't identify, I don't know whom did I shoot 
  or not, but my gun pointed at the people.MR ACKERMAN: It is important 
  for me to know if it is possible, as much as it is important for your people 
  who suffered, to know who killed. I don't know why it is so important for me, 
  but it just is. If you don't remember, I will accept that. I have heard you 
  through your Attorney say and into the microphone, apologise and I have also 
  heard your leadership extend an invitation to my church leadership which is 
  still required, I think, to be considered, that they want to come to our church 
  to offer condolences and they said that they would bring you along, whether 
  or not you receive amnesty in a show of reconciliation. I would like to hear 
  from each one of you as you look me in the face, that you are sorry for what 
  you have done, that you regret it and that you want to be personally reconciled. 
  You can speak in your own language directly to me, you don't have to worry about 
  the microphone.MR MAKOMA: We are sorry for what we have done. It was 
  the situation in South Africa. Although people died during that struggle, we 
  didn't do that out of our own will. It is the situation that we were living 
  under. We are asking from you, please do forgive us. All that we did, we can 
  see the results today.MR MLAMBISA: I am also asking for an apology. As 
  we were working under orders, we didn't know that this will come to such a place. 
  We wanted to be where we are today. We were working under the orders. As the 
  TRC is alive today, we hope that this will come to an end. I hope that you do 
  forgive me, because I ask for forgiveness. Thank you.MR MKHUMBUZI: I 
  also want to say I do apologise to those people who were in the church at that 
  time, while there was that shooting. We also thought that we would meet with 
  the church members, those who were there. Even if we can also go to the church 
  to show that we want reconciliation with them under the circumstances that we 
  were, I also say please forgive me to everybody who is White and Black, who 
  are in this new South Africa. Thank you.MR ACKERMAN: I want you to know 
  that I forgive you unconditionally. I do that because I am a Christian and I 
  can forgive you for the hurt that you have caused me, but I cannot forgive you 
  the sin that you have done. Only God can forgive you for that and I plead with 
  you, when God saved me, he gave me something that I can't explain and that is 
  love. A love for people, all people to have what I have. I can't explain it, 
  He just gave it to me. When I look at you and I think of your Commander I think 
  it was Vusi, that has died in an accident, I can only think that he had died 
  without Christ, you still have a chance and I appeal to you, to return to the 
  faith of your parents. I understand that you were all brought up in Christian 
  homes. I appeal to you to go back to your parents, to ask them for forgiveness 
  too and that you would consider the Christian gospel, Christ as the mediator, 
  the person that can forgive you from eternal sin. You are going to have to consider 
  that and I appeal to you to do it. Mr Bembridge, thank you.ADV BEMBRIDGE: 
  Thank you Mr Chairman. We have nothing further, Mr Chairman.
  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV BEMBRIDGE 
  CHAIRMAN: Mr Arendse, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?CROSS-EXAMINATION 
  BY ADV ARENDSE: Just one Mr Chairman. Mr Ackerman, can I just say from our 
  side that during your moving testimony, that I think we were only beginning 
  to appreciate what you have gone through and only in these brief moments, have 
  we been able to share that with you. I just want to ask you one question, do 
  you not think that reconciliation in respect of these applicants would be better 
  served, by them being granted amnesty instead of them staying behind bars and 
  serving out their prison sentences?MR ACKERMAN: Mr Arendse I am too subjectively 
  close to be able to make a valued judgement like that. It is my position that 
  the sword has been given to the State, that it is their responsibility to decide. 
  It has been my objective to get the truth, to get to the truth. If in this process, 
  we have established that and I must leave that to the Committee to evaluate 
  and to decide on, if they feel and it is for them to decide that, if they feel 
  that the requirements that the law has laid down for these gentlemen to get 
  amnesty, then they must give them amnesty. If they feel that they have not met 
  the requirements, then they must decide and decide to refuse them amnesty. I 
  and my family will abide by your decision, lady and gentlemen and I know too, 
  that that is the official position of my church, that the church will abide 
  by whatever decision is taken here today or will be taken as a result of today.ADV 
  ARENDSE: From what you've heard here today, are you personally satisfied 
  that you've heard all the relevant facts that relate to what happened that day?MR 
  ACKERMAN: Mr Arendse, that is not my call. I can't, I am too subjective, 
  I can tell you what my subjective answer is and my subjective answer is no, 
  I don't think that I've heard everything. I think there might yet be something 
  more, but is that because I want them to tell more, or is that because there 
  is more? I am too subjective Mr Arendse. That is why we have a Committee. That 
  is why we have people like you and Mr Bembridge, to get to the bottom of the 
  truth. It is not me.ADV ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no other 
  questions. Thank you Mr Ackerman.MR ACKERMAN: Thank you. Mr Judge, may 
  I thank you for the opportunity to, I am not sure whether I have overstepped 
  the boundaries of this particular Committee in what I did with the applicants, 
  in asking them to face me, if I have, I apologise, but I am sure that you can 
  understand. Thank you very much for this opportunity. We need reconciliation.CHAIRMAN:	
  We understand Mr Ackerman. Thank you. Mr Brink, are there any questions you 
  wish to put to this witness?
NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINKCHAIRMAN: Thank you Mr Ackerman.MR 
  ACKERMAN: Thank you.WITNESS EXCUSED
  ADV BEMBRIDGE: We have no further witnesses Mr Chairman. CHAIRMAN: 
  Mr Bembridge, did I understand that you were in a position to hand in a written 
  address to the Committee? ADV BEMBRIDGE: I am unfortunately not yet in 
  that position, no Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: Yes. ADV BEMBRIDGE: My 
  submissions are being prepared, but they are not yet finalised.CHAIRMAN: 
  When do you expect that to be ready Mr Bembridge? ADV BEMBRIDGE: It will 
  possibly be ready later this afternoon, but given your indications that the 
  Committee does not intend to sit past four o'clock, I don't know if it will 
  be ready by that time.CHAIRMAN: Will you be able to bring them in tomorrow 
  morning or send them in tomorrow?ADV BEMBRIDGE: That could probably be 
  arranged.CHAIRMAN: Yes. Mr Arendse?ADV ARENDSE: Mr Chairman, I 
  could address you shortly alternatively hand up written submissions, but I am 
  afraid it is not going to be until Monday.CHAIRMAN: The matter is of 
  great gravity and I think that justice should be done properly and if it means 
  giving you a day or two to do it, the Committee would be prepared to do that.ADV 
  ARENDSE: Thank you Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: Mr Bembridge, likewise, 
  if Mr Arendse has until Monday to hand in his written submissions, if you find 
  it necessary to do so, you could also have that time to make your submissions 
  available to the offices here by Monday.ADV BEMBRIDGE: I will do that 
  Mr Chairman, thank you.CHAIRMAN: Thank you. Mr Brink, is there anything 
  further?MR BRINK: Just one thing Mr Chairman. Co-member of your Committee, 
  Adv De Jager, asked me to ascertain whether the applicant Makoma was assisting 
  in his application for amnesty in respect of the police ambush which is referred 
  to in his application, I understand that he is not.CHAIRMAN: While we 
  are about it, your clients are out on bail, two of them? ADV ARENDSE: 
  That is correct.CHAIRMAN: What are the offences for which they are out 
  on bail?ADV ARENDSE: They are out on bail in respect of the St James 
  incident, Mkhumbuzi and Mlambisa.CHAIRMAN: In respect of the same offences 
  that Mr Makoma was charged with?ADV ARENDSE: And found guilty and sentenced, 
  yes.CHAIRMAN: Mr Brink, are you in a position to talk to us about the 
  matter that was set down for tomorrow morning?MR BRINK: I understand 
  that Mr Mpshe is here to deal with that?CHAIRMAN: Yes, Mr Mpshe, can 
  you come forward please.ADV MPSHE: Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, 
  I am going to request for a postponement in tomorrow's matter Mr Chairman. First 
  perhaps I must request that it be done today, even if the matter was scheduled 
  for tomorrow. The reasons for the postponement Mr Chairman, are that a request 
  has been made by both the legal representatives for the applicant, Mr Riaan 
  Bellingham as well as the legal representative for the victims. I have their 
  requests in writing. Mr Chairman, the second reason is that as a result of investigation 
  that was conducted by our investigative unit, it has emerged that certain people 
  are likely to be implicated and these people have not yet been informed accordingly.CHAIRMAN: 
  That has only come to light recently? ADV MPSHE: Recently Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: 
  Yes.ADV MPSHE: And the Act enjoins us to inform the said people in terms 
  of Section 19 of our enabling Act. Mr Chairman, I may further state that I have 
  discussed the matter pertaining to the date with both Attorneys on both sides, 
  and the dates agreed upon are the 13th to the 16th of October, current year.CHAIRMAN: 
  In Cape Town?ADV MPSHE: In Cape Town Mr Chairman. CHAIRMAN: The 
  name of the case?ADV MPSHE: The name of the case it is Thabelo Johannes 
  Mbelo, that is the first applicant. The second applicant Willem Riaan Bellingham, 
  matter is number 3785/96 and 5283/97.CHAIRMAN: Thank you.ADV MPSHE: 
  Mr Chairman, may I further state that the lawyers on both sides have requested 
  me to put this on record that they will not be available and they are not here 
  currently, but they are aware of the postponement as well as the victims. When 
  I phoned the lawyers yesterday, he was with them and he conveyed this to them. 
  The only problem that we have is one, it is about one of the Africans, that 
  is Mr Mbelo. Mr Mbelo has not been notified but attempts have been made. He 
  is currently in the South African Police Service, we left three messages with 
  a Mr Ruiter who said at four o'clock Mr Mbelo will be reporting at the police 
  station and he shall inform him accordingly. We shall endeavour further to make 
  sure that we talk to him personally. Thank you Mr Chairman.CHAIRMAN: 
  The matter of Mbelo and Bellingham is accordingly adjourned till the 13th to 
  the 16th of October, 1997 here in Cape Town. ADV MPSHE: Thank you Mr 
  Chairman.CHAIRMAN: If there is nothing further, the Committee will now 
  adjourn. Before adjourning, I must thank counsel on both sides who have assisted 
  in making the work of the Committee perhaps a little less difficult than it 
  is. Thank you.COMMITTEE ADJOURNS. --------------------
