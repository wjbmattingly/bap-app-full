--------------------------------------------------------------------------ON RESUMPTION:
CHAIRPERSON:   ... in Johannesburg this morning for the Chairman of the Committee to recuse himself.  There was prolonged argument and argument is continuing this afternoon.  The undertaking we got that they would adjourn at one o'clock and Mr Wagener would be here with us at two, is now worthless.  I do not propose to ask you gentlemen to sit here until four o'clock on the off- chance that he may finish in Johannesburg and manage to come here.  I would ask you rather, can you be here tomorrow morning?
MR ALBERTS:   Yes certainly Mr Chairman.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten o'clock.  I do not think you should be here earlier.  Did you hear what I am saying Mr Du Plessis?
MR DU PLESSIS:   Mr Chairman, I am very sorry, I was standing outside, I didn't realise that you had started.
CHAIRPERSON:   Due to changes in Johannesburg, Mr Wagener will not, they did not adjourn at one o'clock as we were told they would, he will not be here.  I do not propose to ask you gentlemen to wait here until four o'clock in case he does.  I propose if it suits you, to adjourn until ten o'clock tomorrow morning by which time he should have been able to walk over from Johannesburg.
