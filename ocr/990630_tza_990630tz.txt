MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I agree.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, I will proceed 
  and read the affidavit.
                "I, 
  the undersigned Brian Clifford Thobejane, do hereby make an oath and state that 
  I am the applicant herein.  The facts to which I depose are true and correct 
  and within my personal knowledge, unless the context indicates otherwise.  I 
  was born on the 27th of December 1974 in Garankua and I grew up in Soshanguve.  
  We were four children at home and I am the third born child and the only son.  
  My parents divorced whilst I was still in exile.  My mother is presently working 
  at Garankua Hospital as a cooker, my father is unemployed.  I did my primary 
  and secondary education in Soshanguve.  I left school in January 1991 when I 
  left the country to join APLA.  I left the country via Botswana to Tanzania.  
  I joined PAC in 1987 through AZANIO.  I was influenced to join the PAC by the 
  late Senior Commander of APLA, Jan Shobe.  I underwent military training in 
  Tanzania and Zimbabwe.  In Tanzania I did my basic training and in Zimbabwe 
  I did a course of Intelligence.  I stayed in Zimbabwe from 1992 until March 
  1993, when comrade Fihla deployed myself and other comrades inside the country.  
  Comrade Fihla is currently a General in the South African National Defence Force.  
  The other comrades that were with me when I was briefed by comrade Fihla were 
  Thabo and Max.  We travelled from Harare to Bulowayo by train and we were in 
  possession of various arms and ammunition, including AK47's, Tokarev pistols, 
  Chinese stick grenades, etc.  From Bulowayo to the borders of Botswana, we travelled 
  on a bakkie.  We crossed the borders on foot and from Botswana to South African 
  borders we travelled on a bakkie and we also crossed the borders on foot.  When 
  we crossed the South African borders, there was a micro-bus already waiting 
  for us.  The micro-bus took us to Johannesburg where we met the Director of 
  Operations, comrade Lethlapa Mpahlela.  Comrade Mpahlela told me that I was 
  to be deployed together with comrade Max in the Northern Province.  He further 
  told me that comrade Prince is already there and we will work with him.  When 
  we arrived at the Northern Province, comrade Prince had already had Task Force 
  members at his disposal and they were trained by him.  The Task Force members 
  were comrades Thomas Ngobeni, Donald Mukhawana and Tekwani Baloyi.  As an APLA 
  operative, my general instruction from APLA High Command was to prosecute the 
  armed struggle with all means against the then racist minority regime, which 
  was undemocratic and oppressive.  The said armed struggle was in essence a guerrilla 
  warfare, during which we as APLA cadres had to seek and attack the bastions 
  and minions of the aforesaid regime.  The ultimate objective of PAC and APLA 
  was not only to topple the then racist minority regime, but to eventually return 
  the land to the majority of the people of this country.  The bastions and minions 
  of the then erstwhile regime were in terms of the APLA perspective the members 
  of the South African Police and reservists in general, the farmers as they belonged 
  to the Commando structures over and above the fact that they occupied the farms 
  which we had to drive them away from, so as to widen our territorial operational 
  base, which was aimed at eventually consolidating the liberated and repossessed 
  land, the white homes which were garrisons of apartheid.  My general instruction 
  was to seek, identify and attack the enemy who was seen in the context of the 
  above stated bastions and minions of the regime and also to train other cadres 
  and command them in whatever operation that is being embarked upon.  In consequence 
  of and in pursuit of the above stated objectives, during or about 27 May ..."
        Your Worship 
  and Honourable Members, I think 27 April, though the date they are not sure, 
  it is between the 27th/28th in the morning, they are not sure about the date, 
  but it is around 27th/28th of April 1993.
        "... 
  I was part of the Unit of APLA cadres that launched an attack on the farm of 
  Mr Johannes Swanepoel and as a result, his wife lost her life.  Comrade Prince 
  who was the Commander of the Unit, made reconnaissance together with Donald.  
  After the reconnaissance was made, we called the Director of Operations and 
  we briefed him about the potential target and he authorised the operation.  
  He also gave us an extra AK47.  According to the reconnaissance, this particular 
  farm was a meeting place of the right-wingers who were also farmers in addition 
  to the fact that it was regarded as a legitimate target according to APLA's 
  mode of operation.  The whole Unit met on the 26th of April 1993 and was briefed 
  about the operation and we proceeded to the farm and due to the delays, we arrived 
  at the farm around quarter to seven and the gates were already closed and the 
  dogs were barking at us.  We retreated and waited until the early hours of the 
  morning, as we intended to catch them by surprise.  Between five o'clock and 
  six o'clock am, on the 27th April 1993, we jumped the fence of the farm and 
  proceeded to the farm house.  Mr Swanepoel came out, carrying a gun and something 
  which looked like a camera.  I caught him by surprise and pointed him with my 
  gun and drove him back to the house.  His wife was on the phone and I presumed 
  she was phoning the Police.  The Commander, comrade Prince, rushed to the direction 
  of the wife, but outside.  She shot at comrade Prince, but missed him.  Comrade 
  Prince entered the house and he was shot at and he shot back and Mrs Swanepoel 
  died.  At the time of the shooting, I lost Mr Swanepoel and I tried to shoot 
  him, but my gun jammed.  He locked himself in one of the rooms and I tried in 
  vain to open it.  We decided to retreat because we suspected that the Police 
  must be on their way as Mrs Swanepoel was on the phone when she was shot at 
  and they might have heard the shooting through the telephone.  We jumped the 
  fence of the farm and at that time, the helicopter was hovering above us.  We 
  ran through the bush to our respective places.  I had spent about 30 minutes 
  in my place, when comrade Prince and Donald arrived.  Shortly thereafter Police 
  arrived and I threw a stick grenade, but it did not explode.  Comrade Prince 
  came out of the house and there was a shoot-out and he died.   We were arrested 
  and later convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, amongst other things 
  for murder, attempted murder, possession of arms and ammunition and explosives.  
  The crimes for which I was convicted and sentenced, were motivated by my political 
  beliefs and were not for self gain.  The farmers were regarded by the PAC APLA 
  as bastions and minions of the settler regime and as such, legitimate targets, 
  seen in the political context of the time.  I must also state that APLA mode 
  of thinking and indeed operation, did not distinguish between soft and hard 
  targets, nor indeed between military and civilian targets.  We were simply fighting 
  against criminals who sustained the apartheid system.  Criminals because also 
  apartheid was declared by the International Community represented by the United 
  Nations Organisation as crime against humanity.  Anybody who was a driver, moving 
  apartheid forward and those that supported it, were therefore criminals.  That 
  was our thinking during the struggle.  At the time of the commission of the 
  above stated offence, the PAC APLA was still engaged in the armed struggle against 
  the then regime.  I respectfully submit that my application complies with the 
  requirements of the Act and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my 
  involvement in this operation", signed by the applicant.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbandazayo, that affidavit 
  will be received as Exhibit A and as I said earlier, as soon as the photocopying 
  machine is available, copies will be made and given to all the parties.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, 
  now I would just on a few aspects, I will take the applicant on a few aspects, 
  just for him to clarify certain things.  Mr Thobejane, can you take the Committee, 
  Honourable members of the Committee through, give us a picture of what happened 
  on the day in question and take us through what happened when you arrived at 
  Mr Swanepoel's place before you attacked it and after you attacked it, until 
  the time you were arrested, in detail.
MR THOBEJANE:   I think on the 27th, I met the 
  late Prince, who was my immediate Commander.  I was together with Donald Mukhawana, 
  Thomas Ngobeni and Tekwani.  All of us, we slept at the place of the late Prince 
  and then we finalised our plans of going to Mr Swanepoel's place to attack.  
  Each and everyone of us were given his own instructions the day.  The very same 
  day, in the afternoon, we went there but myself, I went there with Thomas Ngobeni 
  because when we were a group of five, we were using a  public transport.  There 
  were some delays because the transport which we were using was the public transport, 
  so it was not ours, we arrived there late at Mr Swanepoel's farm.  We didn't 
  manage to get in by then, because it was late because all the gates were closed 
  and the dogs were barking at us.  Then we thought of retreating until the following 
  day in the morning because the dogs were making a noise and the gates were closed 
  and according to our own plan, we were supposed to have arrived in the farm 
  house before they closed the gates.  We wanted to catch them by surprise but 
  because the dogs were barking, we didn't manage.  Mr Swanepoel's place is in 
  the bushes, we stayed there until the following day in the morning around five 
  o'clock or passed five.  We entered his farm.  The dogs were still barking and 
  we jumped the fence.  We deployed each other, myself and late Prince, we hid 
  ourselves by his garden, facing the door, the front door of Mr Swanepoel's house.  
  The aim was to catch him by surprise when he get out of the house and the other 
  comrades were a little bit at the back.  When he came out, I pointed an AK47 
  at him,  I was armed with it together with the late Prince, we instructed him 
  to stand and then he stood there.  I don't know what he was having, I think 
  it was a camera or a pistol in his hand.  We told him to go back to the house.  
  While Mr Swanepoel was going back to the house, the late Prince was holding 
  him like this at his back and then we took him back to the house.  What I realised 
  is that, I didn't know by then that she was Mrs Swanepoel.  She was having a 
  pistol and she was holding a phone as well, so they late approached her.  What 
  I can remember is that Mrs Swanepoel shot at us while I was still with Mr Swanepoel, 
  while I was driving him back to his house.  When we entered, it is when the 
  late was no longer on the window, he was inside the house.  When he arrived, 
  he was on the passage, Mrs Swanepoel shot at him but she missed.   The late 
  Prince was having a Tokarev pistol, he fired back, he didn't fire a lot of shots, 
  but the first bullet hit her on the chest and Mrs Swanepoel fell.  I am sorry, 
  let me put this correctly, when we started shooting Mr Swanepoel wanted to run 
  away, so I was having an AK47 in my hand, I pointed it at him, I wanted to shoot 
  at him, it didn't go off, it jammed.  Mr Swanepoel entered in one of his rooms 
  and locked himself in, but we didn't manage to open the door.    We had realised 
  that Mrs Swanepoel phoned and although they didn't hear what she was saying, 
  the phone was laying down, so they could hear that there was something going 
  on in the house.  Then we called off the operation.  The late Prince instructed 
  us to withdraw, then we withdrew.  We withdrew and jumped the fence to the bushes.  
  The helicopters were around by then.  We manoeuvred ourselves into the bushes, 
  they didn't manage to catch us.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Before you proceed, tell the 
  Committee, do you know what was the name of Prince, his actual name?
MR THOBEJANE:   During that time I only knew 
  that he was Prince.  I did not know about his real name which is Fanual Modau.  
  I learnt at a later stage, after my arrest that his name is Fanual Modau.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Then after you had jumped the 
  fence and the helicopter was hovering above yourselves and you managed to escape, 
  what happened thereafter?
MR THOBEJANE:   We entered the bush and started 
  running, the helicopters were too hovering over.  We managed to run away from 
  them because we were trained to hide ourselves until we reached our place.  
  When we arrived at our place, before we reached our place, on the way, on the 
  road, the late Prince, Donald Mukhawana and Tekwani, they went away, being three, 
  having those ammunitions which we were using.  Myself, I took the Tokarev pistol 
  and one China stick grenade, I was together with Thomas and then we arrived 
  then at our hiding place and Thomas went to his house, I went to where I was 
  staying, alone.  I didn't stay there for a long time.  After 30 minutes, Thomas 
  and the late Prince, I am sorry, Donald and the late Prince came back to me.  
  They were having a bag which was having our ammunitions.  While we were still 
  there, we saw a white car, there is someone who came to tell us that there is 
  a white car patrolling the area and we realised that this was a Police car, 
  and there were white people inside.    The white guys came out of the car - 
  enough arms, we only had one Chinese stick grenade and one pistol.   We entered, 
  we got inside the house, all of us, I took out the Chinese stick grenade, the 
  white guys came towards the door, I opened the door a little bit together with 
  the late Prince and Donald.  When they arrived, there were just some young girls 
  playing outside.  I took out the stick grenade and threw it to them, when I 
  threw it to them, then they ran for cover.   The late Prince got out of the 
  house with a pistol in his hand.  There was a certain white man who was coming 
  forward, approaching us and the late Prince shot at him and then he took cover 
  and then the late Prince ran away.   Because I did not want to kill him, the 
  grenade which I threw, I didn't pin it off, because I didn't want to kill the 
  innocent children who were playing around.  When the late Prince went out, I 
  went to him, followed him only to find that all of them were out of the cover, 
  they started shooting.   I had to go back into the house, that is what happened 
  in short.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   How were you arrested?
MR THOBEJANE:   When I went back to the house 
  because they had realised where we were, then they started shouting at us by 
  a loudspeaker, they said "don't attempt shooting, don't fight" and 
  they started shooting at the house while we were inside the house.  I just saw 
  by dust that they started to shoot, because there were huts in the villages, 
  they are made from mud and then they entered, they found me with Donald inside 
  the house and they took us out.  They didn't say anything to us, they started 
  assaulting us, harassing us.  They said we should lay down, they started searching 
  us, they searched the house.  By that time, they were very many and they put 
  us inside a van.  That is how they arrested us.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   That is all Chairperson and 
  Honourable members, at this stage, thank you.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Mbandazayo.  Mr 
  Van Rensberg, do you have any questions to ask the applicant?


MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.   
  I am just experiencing a problem at this stage and this is that I have not seen 
  the affidavit from which the applicant - used as a base to give his evidence.  
  I think it is necessary for me to obtain that document and if I can therefore 
  ask that we just adjourn for say 15 minutes, so that I can just get a copy thereof 
  please.
CHAIRPERSON:   I don't know if you can get a 
  copy thereof because we haven't got the photocopying, but I am sure Mr Mbandazayo 
  will let you have the original.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you very much.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think if we could adjourn 
  let's say for 10 minutes, thank you.
COMMITTEE ADJOURNS
ON RESUMPTION:
BRIAN CLIFFORD THOBEJANE:   (still under oath)
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that the photocopying machine 
  has arrived, so we should all be in possession of the affidavit.  Mr Van Rensberg?
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank 
  you Mr Chairman.  Mr Thobejane, can you please tell us who identified the farm 
  of Mr Swanepoel as the target for your attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   It was identified by the late 
  Prince.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At what stage were you informed 
  of the identity of the farm that you were going to attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   I arrived in March, in April, 
  he told me about this.
CHAIRPERSON:   Could you give, Mr Thobejane, 
  some indication of approximately how long before the actual attack was, were 
  you informed of the target?
MR THOBEJANE:   It was three weeks before.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you actually yourself 
  carry out a reconnaissance of the property before the attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   No, I was not in the Reconnaissance 
  Team.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   But is it not so that by 
  the time that you went to the farm to attack the farm, you knew that it is a 
  chicken farm, owned by a white farmer, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can you please repeat your question.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is, by the time 
  that you went to the farm to attack it, you knew that it was a chicken farm, 
  owned by a white farmer?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I knew that was a chicken 
  farm and it was owned by Mr Swanepoel.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you also know that on 
  a daily basis, because of the sale of chickens, there are large amounts of cash 
  being kept on the premises?
MR THOBEJANE:   As to whether there is a lot 
  of cash which they used to put in the house, I did not know.  I did not know 
  whether he was putting money or not in the farm.  It was not my responsibility 
  to know about that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Thobejane, for exactly 
  which counts, charges were you eventually found guilty of in a court of law?
MR THOBEJANE:   It was murder, attempted murder, 
  possession of arms and ammunition and explosives and attempted robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Were all five of you found 
  guilty, or all three of you found guilty of attempted robbery?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, all of us.
CHAIRPERSON:   Just on that point, if I may 
  ask a question.  At your trial, Mr Thobejane, did you raise the political element 
  of your operation?
MR THOBEJANE:   During the trial, no, but after 
  we were found guilty, during the mitigation of sentence, I indicated that I 
  was a member of APLA, I was trained as a member of APLA and I was a member of 
  the PAC as well.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Van Rensberg.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr 
  Thobejane, when you gave evidence this morning and also in your application 
  for amnesty and in particular paragraph 9(a)(i) thereof, it is very conspicuous 
  that you did not mention this conviction of attempted robbery and the question 
  is, why not?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Is he seeking amnesty in respect 
  of that, that should be the question?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairperson, 
  I don't think from the application it seems that the applicant is seeking amnesty 
  for that and that is part of my question and my cross-questioning, why not, 
  if that is then omitted.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Which paragraph are you referring 
  to, 9(a) "furnish sufficient particulars of the acts associated with a 
  political objective in respect of which amnesty is sought", if he is not 
  seeking amnesty, did you expect him to include an offence for which he is not 
  seeking amnesty?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Is that the ambit of your 
  question?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, yes, in fact I would 
  expect them because obviously my question aims in the direction of the full 
  disclosure of the facts, also the motivation on which the attack was based and 
  I will try to show through my cross-examination that these facts are deliberately 
  omitted from the application and also from the statements made by the applicant.
CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.
ADV BOSMAN:   I don't know whether I am perhaps 
  now jumping the gun, but should you not then be referring to paragraph 12(e) 
  where the applicant is specifically asked to state in respect of what he was 
  found guilty and sentenced?  Surely paragraph 9(a) is self-explanatory?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I agree, thank you Mr 
  Chairperson.  I have omitted to quote that specific one, I have it here on my 
  notes, it is actually omitted to be mentioned in 12(e) as well.  Thank you.  

CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Thobejane, do you want 
  me to repeat the question?  The question is, why did you omit to bring to the 
  attention of the hearing in your statement this morning, as well as in your 
  application referring to paragraph 12(e), the fact that you have also been convicted 
  of attempted robbery?
MR THOBEJANE:   When I went to Mr Swanepoel's 
  place, my intention was not to rob.   I was convicted of something which I did 
  not know and I was forced by the Security Branch, that now I went there to rob, 
  but that was not my intention, that was not our intention.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, Mr Thobejane, we may 
  accept that, the question is why didn't you tell this Commission and why wasn't 
  it mentioned before during your evidence this morning?
MR THOBEJANE:   The reason I did not tell the 
  Committee is because I didn't even tell them about the murder, the attempted 
  murder, the possession of arms and the possession of - I never explained specifically, 
  I never mentioned to them specifically what I was charged with or convicted 
  with.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I put it to you Mr Thobejane, 
  that that is exactly what you did say.  You were exactly asked what you were 
  convicted of and it was also requested of you to disclose that in paragraph 
  12(e) of your application?
CHAIRPERSON:   I don't think so, sorry.  Oh 
  yes, in 12(e), sorry, I am looking at 9(a).  Yes?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes, that is applicable Mr 
  Van Rensberg, in respect of paragraph 12, but not in respect of paragraph 9(a), 
  I think it is - that is what I was objecting to, that it is unfair to put it 
  in that fashion, because what paragraph 9(a) merely seeks from an applicant 
  is to indicate in respect of which acts he seeks amnesty.  If it is not his 
  intention to apply for amnesty for attempted robbery, then it is his prerogative 
  not to include it, because then if he has not applied for that, this Committee 
  will not grant him that.  It doesn't prejudice him and it is not, it doesn't 
  go to the question of whether he has properly disclosed or not.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson, 
  as I have stated, my question aims more  to the particulars contained in 12(e) 
  than in 9.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Sorry members of the Committee, 
  we just have a slight problem in terms of interpretations.  We were asked to 
  use only one language, but we have a problem because the applicant is a Tswana 
  speaking, but we adopted to Sotho, but there is a problem.  Now he is going 
  to try to use English in answering the questions.  
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   What is the problem?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   He was answering in all the 
  languages.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   (Microphone not on)
MR MBANDAZAYO:   The problem is that there is 
  no Interpreter for his language, so he is trying to adopt ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   (Microphone not on)  I don't 
  want to sit with an applicant who is now going to say "this is not what 
  I intended saying, if I said it in my  language, I would have been understood 
  properly", is he going to be able, is it going to be comfortable to give 
  evidence in a language that he has previously indicated, he is not comfortable 
  in?  I have noticed that he uses English and the other Sotho languages interchangeably, 
  but maybe he is comfortable with that.  Is there any problem with the Sotho 
  translator in understanding Tswana?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   The problem I understand that 
  he is messing up the tape when he is using all the languages simultaneously.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   But does it present any problem 
  in the Translator being able to translate to us?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   No Chairperson.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes, that shouldn't be a major 
  problem.
CHAIRPERSON:   I think if we proceed, if you 
  have any difficulty Mr Thobejane, with the language, please indicate immediately 
  to Mr Mbandazayo that you've got a problem.
MR THOBEJANE:   What I am asking Mr Chairperson, 
  is that the Translator doesn't translate in Sotho, I will understand English 
  because he is confusing me.  He cannot even translate in Sotho, so I will ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Is that so?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   What Translator do we have, 
  what language is he translating in?
MR THOBEJANE:   Tsonga.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   In Tsonga?
MR THOBEJANE:   He is translating in Sotho, 
  but he is not perfect, I am sorry to say that.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   If you could translate in English 
  for Mr Thobejane and then if you do have any difficulty Mr Thobejane, don't 
  suffer it, please tell Mr Mbandazayo immediately.
MR THOBEJANE:   Thank you.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   The Translator is Tsonga.
MS MTANGA:   Chairperson, if I may come in, 
  the agreement was that he would listen to questions in English and then he would 
  answer is Tswana and then the problem would be, he would be speaking is Tswana 
  but he would be listening in English, so I don't know what exactly ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Mr Mbandazayo, can he proceed 
  in English, do you think he is going to be comfortable in having to give his 
  evidence in English because the way in which things are being indicated to us 
  by Ms Mtanga, I think it is merely going to create confusion with him.  He can't 
  be listening in English and then speaking in Tswana because he has a problem 
  with the way in which the translation is Tswana comes out from the Translator.
MS MTANGA:   I think the problem that has been 
  raised is that when he changes languages ...
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but let's find out exactly 
  what the problem is, because we can't just debate it here, otherwise we must 
  have an adjournment, get another translator or whatever, but let's find out 
  from Mr Thobejane, what is the difficulty?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Okay, Chairperson, we agree 
  that he is going to use English.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr 
  Thobejane, can you now answer the question please?
CHAIRPERSON:   The question Mr Thobejane is 
  that if you take a look at paragraph 12(e) of your application that you completed 
  for submission to the Commission, the question there is "offence in respect 
  of which found guilty and sentenced, if applicable", and then you have 
  put in "murder, attempted murder, possession of ammunition, possession 
  of machine guns, possession of explosives, possession of pistol, etc", 
  now what Mr Van Rensberg is asking is why didn't you put attempted robbery there, 
  that is the question?
MR THOBEJANE:   In my application there is an 
  abbreviation of etc, which it etcetera.
CHAIRPERSON:   It is there.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Paragraph 12(e), Chairperson, 
  12(e).
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Thobejane.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Pardon, I didn't follow that 
  answer.
CHAIRPERSON:   There is etc, etcetera.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Etcetera, I see.  Okay, the 
  question remains this morning when you gave evidence, you also omitted to mention 
  that fact, why?
MR THOBEJANE:   I forgot to.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What was the sentence that 
  you received for this attempted murder conviction?
CHAIRPERSON:   Attempted robbery?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Attempted robbery, thank 
  you Mr Chairperson?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't remember, I am sorry.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Fine, let's go on.  You say 
  that when Mr Swanepoel came out of the house on that fateful morning, he was 
  in possession of a gun, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   I said so, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What kind of gun was it?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't know the kind.
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it a rifle or a pistol or 
  a handgun?
MR THOBEJANE:   It was a pistol, I am sorry.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   When you saw Mr Swanepoel 
  first, was this pistol in his hand or in his waist or where was it?
MR THOBEJANE:   On his hand.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   How far were you from Mr 
  Swanepoel at that stage, when you apprehended him with a gun as you testified?
MR THOBEJANE:   Some few metres, about 10 to 
  15.
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Thobejane, at that stage, 
  was it light or was it still dark?
MR THOBEJANE:   It was light.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And you commanded him to 
  stand still if I followed your evidence correctly, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, it is correct.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What happened to this gun 
  Mr Swanepoel had?
MR THOBEJANE:   It fell to the ground and the 
  camera as well.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At what stage did it fall 
  to the ground?
MR THOBEJANE:   Because I took him by surprise 
  you know, and when I instructed him to halt, I was arising from the flowers 
  and he was terrified, it just fell to the ground.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Are you saying he let go 
  of this gun and the camera and it fell there on the ground where he stood?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I think Mr Swanepoel was 
  terrified.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is Mr Thobejane, 
  did the gun and the camera fall to the ground there where he stood?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I said so sir.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And you immediately then 
  proceeded to march Mr Swanepoel into the house, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   That is correct.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What happened to this gun 
  and the camera afterwards?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't know what happened to 
  them, but we just left them there.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know if that gun was 
  loaded?
MR THOBEJANE:   I won't tell you about that 
  one.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Are you expecting this hearing 
  to believe that you left the guy's firearm there in the flowers and marched 
  him back into the house?
MR THOBEJANE:   I did not leave the firearm 
  from the flowers, from the ground where he was standing.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you leave the firearm 
  there on the ground?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I did.
CHAIRPERSON:   I suppose we can believe it if 
  he was only found guilty of attempted robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean if it was taken, then 
  it would have been robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I believe so Your Worship.  
  Do you know if any of your other cadres picked up that gun?
MR THOBEJANE:   I would have known if somebody 
  from our Unit had picked it up.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I put it to you Mr Thobejane, 
  that Mr Swanepoel actually walked out of the house early that morning with medicine 
  for his chickens and that he had no gun and no camera?
MR THOBEJANE:   I have seen that Mr Swanepoel 
  was having a gun on his hand, but now if it happens that he was not having a 
  gun, I have made a mistake, then I am sorry, but now it happened six years back, 
  if I remember well, so if he says that it was not a gun, I won't argue with 
  him.
CHAIRPERSON:   I also think when Mr Thobejane 
  was giving evidence, he didn't say a camera, he said he thought it was a camera, 
  he wasn't sure.
MR THOBEJANE:   Thank you.   
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, let's continue when 
  you marched Mr Swanepoel back to the house, who went into the house with you 
  and Mr Swanepoel?
MR THOBEJANE:   It is myself, I was the only 
  one who marched him into his house, back into the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And the deceased, Mr Prince 
  as you referred to him, what actions did he take when you entered the house 
  with Mr Swanepoel?
MR THOBEJANE:   Mr Prince ran to the bedroom 
  window.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did any of the other cadres, 
  except yourself, at any stage enter into the house?
MR THOBEJANE:   It happened very, very, very 
  fast, I don't remember if anyone had entered the house.  But I haven't seen 
  anyone in the house, except for myself and the late Prince when he was responding 
  to Mrs Swanepoel's shot.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is was the deceased 
  in the house or outside the house when he shot Mrs Swanepoel?
MR THOBEJANE:   The deceased, you are referring 
  to the late Prince or the late Mrs Swanepoel?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Referring to the late Prince, 
  the question was when Modau shot Mrs Swanepoel, was he inside the house or outside 
  the house?
MR THOBEJANE:   Right inside the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So you agree with me that 
  Modau entered into the house with yourself?
MR THOBEJANE:   No, no, not with myself, I entered 
  in the house following Mr Swanepoel, so we did not enter the house at the very 
  same time, maybe he went first or after myself, but not at the same time.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is this one of the instances 
  where you can't exactly remember what happened?
MR THOBEJANE:   I am sorry?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Can't you exactly remember 
  if he did go first or if he did go last?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I can say so.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   When you entered the house, 
  what did you order Mr Swanepoel to do?
MR THOBEJANE:   The order was "go into 
  the house", I did not tell him anything except for that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, after you entered into 
  the house, what did you want him to do?
MR THOBEJANE:   He did not do anything in the 
  house, because he ran away.  I wanted to shoot at him, but my gun jammed, so 
  I did not talk to him after that.
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Mr Van Rensberg 
  is getting at Mr Thobejane is, why did you want to take Mr Swanepoel into the 
  house at all.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.
MR THOBEJANE:   Oh, I am sorry to say that, 
  I wanted to shoot at him in the house, not outside, because it would, the sound 
  of the gun would make a lot of noise and people around would hear that there 
  were people who were shooting and I did not, or according to the plan, we did 
  not want to shoot anyone outside the house, but inside the house, so that there 
  is no noise.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I put it to you Mr Thobejane, 
  that Mr Swanepoel was ordered by yourself after you entered the house, to go 
  to his bedroom and you followed him closely with Mr Modau.
MR THOBEJANE:   It wouldn't be possible because 
  Prince was busy with Mrs Swanepoel.
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is, well it is not 
  a question, it is being put to you, this is just for your comment that Mr Swanepoel 
  was told by you to go to his bedroom.  That was one aspect of it and that you 
  were together with Modau, but what do you say about you saying to Mr Swanepoel 
  "go to the bedroom"?
MR THOBEJANE:   Go to the house, not to the 
  bedroom.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   This bedroom or this room 
  according to your evidence that Mr Swanepoel jumped into when he fled from you, 
  do you agree that is exactly the same room in which Mrs Swanepoel was shot?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't remember well if it 
  was the same room, but what I know is that he ran into one of the rooms in the 
  house and we tried to open, and open, but we couldn't succeed.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you see Mrs Swanepoel 
  in the house?
MR THOBEJANE:   Mrs Swanepoel, when I see her, 
  it was outside, I was still outside.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, let's rephrase the 
  question, did you see Mrs Swanepoel when you were in the house?
MR THOBEJANE:   In the house I did not see her, 
  I had seen her whilst I was still outside.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   How did you see her when 
  you were outside?
MR THOBEJANE:   Through the window.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Now, this window  or the 
  room that you have seen her in, is that the same room where she was eventually 
  shot in?
MR THOBEJANE:   I can say so.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You can say so?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Sorry, I didn't hear.  You 
  can say so?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Now, I put it to you that 
  is exactly the same room, namely the main bedroom, where Mr Swanepoel jumped 
  in and at that same moment when he jumped in, the deceased, Mr Modau shot Mrs 
  Swanepoel.  Can I repeat that for you?  What I am putting to you is that Mr 
  Swanepoel, when he ran away from you, he jumped into the main bedroom and in 
  that same bedroom and simultaneously Mr Modau shot Mrs Swanepoel.
MR THOBEJANE:   If it had happened that way, 
  Mr Prince Modau who shot Mrs Swanepoel, would have also shot Mr Swanepoel, so 
  by the time he shot Mrs Swanepoel, Mr Swanepoel was not in that room.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   I also put it to you that in 
  that very same main bedroom, that is where the safe is in which the guns and 
  the cash are kept, or were kept?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't know about that one.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Thobejane, the operation that 
  night, was it purely to go and attack the farm, was there at any stage ever 
  any talk of repossession?
MR THOBEJANE:   We did not go to the farm to 
  repossess anything, we went there for the shooting or the killing.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Thobejane, it was part 
  of APLA's policy to repossess the farms by attacking the farmers, is that not 
  correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   It is correct, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So, are you now saying that 
  in a way you were trying to repossess the farms over the long term, but you 
  were not ready to repossess the firearms and the cash.
MR THOBEJANE:   No, no, maybe there is a misunderstanding.  
  I was not a member of the Repossession Unit or one of the Repossession Units 
  of APLA, I was not in that Unit.  It is only the Repossession Unit which was 
  responsible for repossessing of whatever it is, but it was not my duty, that 
  one.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Are you saying that you were 
  in the Offensive Unit?
MR THOBEJANE:   I was in the Offensive Unit, 
  I can say so.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And that there was also a 
  Repossession Unit?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And that within APLA all these 
  Units performed different functions?
MR THOBEJANE:   That is correct.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And that your Unit as an Operation 
  Unit was merely to launch an attack and not to repossess?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, that is correct, not to 
  repossess, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairperson.  
  The place where you hid before the attack, was that also the same place where 
  you ran to after the attack, the safe, your hiding place?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can you repeat your question?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I want to know if the place 
  where you stayed before the attack, is that the same place where you ran to 
  immediately after the attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, the same place.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Where is that place?
MR THOBEJANE:   In Runnymead, it is a village.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Who is the owner of that 
  place?
MR THOBEJANE:   The owner of that house is Mr 
  Piet Nociri.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know anything of the 
  whereabouts of this Mr Piet Nociri?
MR THOBEJANE:   All I know is that he was arrested 
  and later discharged because the charges were withdrawn against him and then 
  I haven't seen him after this incident.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Was he charged in the same 
  case as you?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   In your statement which forms 
  part of the Bundle of documents, you mentioned that the orders were given to 
  you by the High Commander of the organisation of APLA in the person of Mr Lethlapa 
  Mpahlela, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   Lethlapa Mpahlela is a member 
  of the High Command, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And he was at the time the 
  Director of Operations as you have testified?
MR THOBEJANE:   The National Director of Operations.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know what the whereabouts 
  of this Mr Mpahlela is at the moment?
MR THOBEJANE:   Not at the moment.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Are you aware of the fact 
  that at one stage Mr Mpahlela was a member of the Parliament of the Republic 
  of South Africa?
MR THOBEJANE:   No, I am not aware of that.  
  I am not aware of that one.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   According to your own knowledge, 
  would you confirm that this Mr Mpahlela knew exactly which farm was going to 
  come under attack and he in fact ordered you to attack that farm?
MR THOBEJANE:   After we have stepped up the 
  reconnaissance, we met with Mr Lethlapa Mpahlela, we briefed him about this 
  operation and he authorised.  He has never seen specifically that farm of Mr 
  Swanepoel.  What we told him was that it was Mr Swanepoel's farm and we have 
  targeted it as one of, it was targeted by our Unit and that is all.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So we can at least deduct 
  that he had full knowledge of the operation?
MR THOBEJANE:   I can say so, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, in your statement, 
  the affidavit which was handed in to evidence this morning, and in particular 
  - pardon your Worship, let me just find the relevant paragraph - paragraph 15 
  thereof,  you gave a definition of the word "criminals" that you used 
  in your evidence, can you just repeat that?
MR THOBEJANE:   Criminals, we are referring 
  to the apartheid regime who were, which was a specific word used by the United 
  Nations because apartheid was a criminal against humanity and the farmers were 
  part and parcel of the apartheid government as we all know that they had formed 
  the Commando Units and all those things.  
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is that your definition?  
  Let me ask you this, did you personally agree with that definition of the word 
  criminal?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can you repeat your question?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You have now given us an 
  interpretation of what the United Nations described as criminals, what I wanted 
  to know is did you personally agree with that strange definition of criminals?
MR THOBEJANE:   Do I agree?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   yes?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, I agree of course.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And would your definition 
  of criminals also include people that kill other people and thereby contravene 
  the laws of the Republic of South Africa?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can you repeat your question?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is does your 
  definition of criminal, your personal definition, also include people that kills 
  other people and thereby contravening the laws of the Republic of South Africa?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, people who contravene the 
  laws of South Africa, according to the criminal law, they are referred to as 
  criminals.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, the question is do you 
  personally agree with that definition as well?
MR THOBEJANE:   At that time, I did not know 
  or understand the criminal law, but now that because I have learnt or went through 
  some study materials, I know that they are referred to as criminals, but by 
  that time I did not know, I am sorry.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   In your statement, or your 
  affidavit, paragraph 11 you also mentioned that the information you had at the 
  time, indicated that Mr Swanepoel's farm was a meeting place of right right-wingers, 
  is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   It is correct yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Can you give us some indication 
  where this information was coming from?
MR THOBEJANE:   We had a Reconnaissance Unit 
  or a Reconnaissance Team that was a sub-Unit from the main Unit.  Its duty was 
  to gather all the information that might be used or that we might use as the 
  Unit so the Reconnaissance Team during their reconnaissance, they have gathered 
  such information because they interviewed some of the workers but they were 
  not aware that they were being investigated, but they have also confirmed that 
  right right-wingers were coming to Mr Swanepoel or were frequenting Mr Swanepoel's 
  place.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So as far as you were concerned, 
  you only gathered that or someone else told you that?
MR THOBEJANE:   The Reconnaissance Team had 
  come up with that information.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, who was this Reconnaissance 
  Team?
MR THOBEJANE:   The late Prince himself was 
  part of it and Donald Mukhawana.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Donald Mukhawana, that is 
  the third applicant in this hearing, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   That is correct.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Isn't he the second applicant, 
  oh, in terms of the affidavit?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   In terms of the affidavit Chairperson, 
  it is the second applicant.
CHAIRPERSON:   On the Bundle, he appears as 
  the third applicant, but it is the same person, one of the applicants in this 
  matter.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   
  Thank you Mr chairperson.   Okay, and
 also in the statement 
  that you have made, which is included  - 
page 9 of the 
  Bundle before this Committee, you said that Piet 
Nocir, I suppose that is Piet 
  Nociri, is that correct -             "...  
gave you some 
  information that this owner of the Ganula Chicken 
Farm, obviously 
  referring to Mr Swanepoel, is a white man who 
did not like 
  black people and also that he is an AWB member in 
the Tzaneen area.
        This information 
  contained or these allegations contained in your statement, did you have first 
  hand evidence of this yourself or is this also information that you obtained 
  from someone else?
MR THOBEJANE:   Mr Piet Nociri was not that 
  much involved in our activities, and then I don't remember him telling me about 
  such information.  
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Can you remember making this 
  statement on the 6th of October 1989?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can I remember doing what?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   1998, pardon Your Worship.  
  Can you remember making this statement which you will find on page 9 and 10 
  and 11 of the Bundle?
MR THOBEJANE:   This statement was not compiled 
  by myself, I am sorry.  The statement you are referring to is the one which 
  us right here on the table.  It was compiled by Fanie Molapo.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is it not your signature 
  there on page 11?
MR THOBEJANE:   This one is not my signature.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, fine, the point I am 
  trying to make is that it looks like the Reconnaissance Unit supplied you as 
  the assault group with information that Mr Swanepoel was frequently being visited 
  by ring right-wingers, that he didn't like black people and that he was an AWB 
  member in the Tzaneen area.  You accepted that information as correct, you yourself, 
  personally, is that not so?
MR THOBEJANE:   No.  
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you perceive it to be 
  incorrect?
MR THOBEJANE:   Not incorrect, but what is happening 
  the reconnaissance will go to the place where we should attack and they should 
  step up information.  They will come with the information to us and now I can 
  not perceive it as wrong, but if a commander says this is the situation and 
  then that is how we are going to work.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So it was accepted as correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   By the Unit, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And by yourself?
MR THOBEJANE:   I am part of the Unit, I can 
  say.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.  If I put it to you 
  that none of these information collected by the Reconnaissance Group is correct, 
  what would you say to that?
MR THOBEJANE:   I won't agree.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Why not, do you have any 
  other information to sustain these allegations?
MR THOBEJANE:   I know we had a very brilliant 
  Reconnaissance Team and they cannot just come with incorrect information and 
  according to the, one of APLA qualities, we were having some qualities there, 
  qualities of a good fighter, we don't bring information which is not correct, 
  false reports.  They cannot report falsely.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, the question is suppose 
  the day before the attack, you received information that this was all false, 
  that Mr Swanepoel has got no affiliations towards the right and that he is not 
  an AWB member, would you still have carried out that attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, we would still carry out 
  the attack because he was a farmer.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And he was a white?  Because 
  he was white?
MR THOBEJANE:   He was a farmer.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you attack or plan to 
  attack any black farmers?
MR THOBEJANE:   If they had defended the interest 
  of that government, formed Commando Units, participated in those Units.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is did you plan 
  to attack any black farmers as well?
MR THOBEJANE:   No, at that stage, no.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.   I put it to you that 
  the sole reason why you attacked that farm was because Mr Swanepoel was white 
  and not because he was AWB or anything of those other reasons?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, but I did not know Mr Swanepoel 
  personally, where I can say I have attacked him because he was a white.  I did 
  not have any personal vendetta against Mr Swanepoel, and then I carried out 
  the operation not because Mr Swanepoel, I know him, he is a white ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   That is not the question, 
  you are being very long winded, the question is didn't you carry out the attack 
  on Mr Swanepoel because he was a white farmer?  It is a very simple question.
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes, we attacked Mr Swanepoel 
  as a white farmer, as a farmer.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson.  
  Okay, now if I read between the lines and also your statements contained in 
  the affidavit, it was part of APLA's policy at the time of which you were a 
  member, to actually force the government of the day into submitting land and 
  to take it away from white farmers and give it to the blacks, was that part 
  of your struggle?
MR THOBEJANE:   Can you repeat your question.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Was it part of APLA's policy 
  at the time, by carrying out these attacks, to persuade or put pressure on the 
  government of the day, to take farms away from the white farmers and give it 
  to the blacks?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At the time, do you agree 
  that Mr Nelson Mandela had been released already, I think three years before 
  the attack, is that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   I am a member of  PAC and I 
  am sorry to say that I had nothing to do with ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Just answer the question Mr 
  Thobejane.  Answer the question, I am sure he is still getting to something, 
  he is laying a basis for further questions to follow.  Mr Mandela had been released 
  at that time, yes or no?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, and at the time there 
  was already, I am talking about April 1993, there was already talk about a full 
  democratic election in this country, is that not so?
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Van Rensberg, we know what 
  you are getting at here, but we also know that APLA only issued instructions 
  to stop operations I think it was on the 16th, I might be wrong of the date 
  of January 1994, which instructions took some time to filter through to the 
  people on the ground.  So if you take a look at the APLA submissions, the party, 
  they were still operative in the struggle in 1993, it was only in January 1994 
  that they actually called a cease-fire.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson, 
  that is actually where I was going.  Mr Thobejane, can you confirm that at one 
  stage the APLA High Command actually gave instructions for you cadres, to stop 
  attacking the white farmers?
MR THOBEJANE:   By that time, I was in jail, 
  1994, I was in jail.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Hm, so you never received 
  those instructions?
MR THOBEJANE:   I only knew about them from 
  somebody else, not directly from a member of the High Command.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I see.  The reason why I 
  am asking these questions Mr Thobejane is the victims in this specific instance, 
  want to have the assurance that if you are granted amnesty, this kind of thing 
  will not happen again.  What is your response to that?
MR THOBEJANE:   I won't attack them again, if 
  he is asking for me alone.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What is the instructions 
  from APLA High Command that has reached your ears?
MR THOBEJANE:   Today, PAC is part of the government 
  of the day, so I don't think they can issue such instructions again, you know, 
  because they are in Parliament themselves.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Chairman, if I can just 
  take instructions for one second please.    Thank you Mr Chairman, there is 
  only one question I still want to ask.  Mr Thobejane, do you know a person by 
  the name of James Baloyi?
MR THOBEJANE:   I know him, yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Can you please tell this 
  hearing how you know him and where his whereabouts are at the moment?
MR THOBEJANE:   I don't know where he is at 
  the moment, but what I know about him is that he is a member of the PAC and 
  the late Prince had stayed by his house and he was part of our Unit.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Are you saying that James 
  Baloyi was also part of your assault group?
MR THOBEJANE:   Jameson Baloyi?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes?
MR THOBEJANE:   Not part of the assault group.
CHAIRPERSON:   He said that the late Prince 
  stayed at his place.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At his place.
MR THOBEJANE:   Are you referring to Tekwani 
  Baloyi or Jameson Baloyi?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:  James Baloyi, are there many 
  James Baloyi's you know?
MR THOBEJANE:   Jameson Baloyi.
CHAIRPERSON:   Jameson Baloyi.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Jameson Baloyi?
MR THOBEJANE:   I know Jameson Baloyi, Prince 
  had stayed at his house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   That is in the same region 
  where you also had your hiding place, isn't that correct?
MR THOBEJANE:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And this Jameson Baloyi, 
  in fact knew of the eminent attack?
MR THOBEJANE:   No, he was not in the Attacking 
  Unit.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairperson, 
  I've got no further questions.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank 
  you Mr Chairperson, let me just find my way.   Mr Mukhawana, on the day of the 
  attack on the farm, can you just tell us, did you enter the house?
MR MUKHAWANA:   On the day of the attack, Mr 
  Swanepoel's farm, I never entered the house, I was standing on the door when 
  the late ordered that we should withdraw because the dogs were barking.  I never 
  entered the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you see the deceased, 
  Mr Modau firing shots into the house from outside?
MR MUKHAWANA:   Where I was standing, I was 
  able to see the late because it was a passage from the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Could you actually see down 
  that passage?
MR MUKHAWANA:   Yes, I could see from outside.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you see Mr Swanepoel 
  jumping into the room, away from the previous applicant which had the AK47, 
  could you see that?
MR MUKHAWANA:   I only saw Mr Swanepoel when 
  he ran to the right hand side, in the room at the right hand side, I don't know 
  what happened in the house after that.

ON RESUMPTION:
MR MBANDAZAYO:   The next applicant Chairperson, 
  is Thomas Ngobeni.
THOMAS NGOBENI:   (sworn states)

 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.
EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:   Mr Ngobeni, 
  the affidavit which is in front of you, is also before the Honourable Committee, 
  members of the Committee, do you confirm that this affidavit was made by yourself 
  and you abide by its contents?
MR NGOBENI:   Yes.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, that is the evidence 
  for the applicant.
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit, Mr Van Rensberg, 
  you have a copy and Ms Mtanga, that will be received as Exhibit C.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Thank you Chairperson.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Van Rensberg?

 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank 
  you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Ngobeni, can you just tell us for which offences you 
  are making application for amnesty?
MR NGOBENI:   Yes, I can tell you.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Please proceed.
CHAIRPERSON:   If you can just tell what offences 
  you are applying for amnesty, that is the question.
MR NGOBENI:   It is murder, illegal possession 
  of firearm and ammunition and attempted robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Can you tell us what evidence 
  was led in the criminal trial, that led to your conviction of attempted robbery?
MR NGOBENI:   Can you repeat your question.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The question is can you just 
  briefly tell this Commission what evidence were led, was led, during the criminal 
  trial that led to your conviction on the count of attempted robbery?
MR NGOBENI:   What I can remember on attempted 
  robbery, we never gave any evidence because our aim was not to rob.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I am asking what evidence 
  was led from the State's side?
MR NGOBENI:   They only told us that we are 
  charged with attempted robbery, but I never heard Mr Swanepoel talking about 
  attempted robbery.
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that you should just 
  be a bit more specific Mr Van Rensberg, because I am sure that we can all accept 
  that at the trial, there was evidence of entering the farm premises without 
  permission, being armed, shooting, entering into the house, all of which could 
  constitute a basis for attempted robbery.  Was there any evidence led at the 
  trial of any of you unsuccessfully actually trying to take any specific item 
  from the premises?
MR NGOBENI:   There was no one that attempted 
  to take anything from the house, because even on our plan, it was not there 
  to rob.  I am sure there was no one who was intending to take anything or to 
  rob anything from the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.   
  At the trial, at the time of the trial, did you use as a defence, the fact that 
  you were members of APLA and that you actually attacked the farm for political 
  motives?
MR NGOBENI:   Yes, that is correct.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   But I gather from your previous 
  statement that you actually did not give evidence yourself, is that not correct?
MR NGOBENI:   I don't understand which statement 
  you are talking about.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, let's be more direct.  
  Did you give evidence on your own behalf and in your own defence, at the time 
  of the criminal trial?
MR NGOBENI:   I don't understand whether you 
  are talking about evidence in court given by myself?
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that is what Mr 
  Van Rensberg is asking, did you during your trial in court, give evidence yourself?
MR NGOBENI:   Yes, I gave evidence, but the 
  evidence I gave after I was arrested, some of those were coerced to make such 
  evidence.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   May I interpose Mr Van Rensberg, 
  maybe just to assist with regard to this.  Did you give evidence in mitigation 
  of your sentence, to the effect that the offence for which you had been convicted 
  were politically motivated, is that the kind of evidence that you are referring 
  to when you say you gave evidence of a political nature in your defence?
MR NGOBENI:   Yes, after sentence, I gave evidence 
  in mitigation of sentence.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes.
MR NGOBENI:   And I gave it wilfully.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Apart from giving evidence 
  in mitigation, did you actually also give evidence in defence of yourself or 
  not, only in mitigation?
MR NGOBENI:   I also gave some evidence before 
  we were convicted, even before we went to, but the evidence that I gave is not 
  the same evidence that I gave in mitigation of sentence, so to say.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, and the difference was 
  that when you gave evidence in your own defence, you did not mention that you 
  were a member of APLA and that you attacked the farm for political reasons, 
  is that not so?
MR NGOBENI:   It is not correct, I explained 
  that I was a member of APLA.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Let's not get confused, did 
  you explain to the Court the first time when you gave evidence on your own behalf, 
  before you were found guilty, did you give evidence then that you were a member 
  of APLA?
MR NGOBENI:   I don't know if - I forgotten 
  because it is a long time ago, but I remember telling the Court, but I am not 
  sure whether I didn't say, but I think I told the Court that I was a member 
  of APLA.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I put it to you and 
  that is also the evidence of the first applicant, the real situation is that 
  you never during your defence of the case, informed the Court that you actually 
  attacked the farm for political motives and you only mentioned that in mitigation.  
  Do you agree with that?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Mr Van Rensberg, do you personally 
  have instructions in relation to this point, if you put it to him, will your 
  client also say something to that effect?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Perhaps I can just take specific 
  instructions on that.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes, before putting it to 
  him, yes.  You know if you are not going to substantiate it ...
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I just want to confirm 
  that.  Chairperson, I have in fact confirmed my instructions and I can put it 
  to this witness specifically that the victim will come and testify to confirm 
  my previous allegation.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   You may proceed to do so.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you, just to clear 
  up any confusion, I want to put it to you that Mr Swanepoel will come and testify 
  that he was present during the hearing of your case and that neither yourself 
  or any of the other applicants in today's hearing, made any mention during the 
  defence stage of your criminal hearing, made mention of the fact that you attacked 
  a farm for political motives.  What do you say to that?
MR NGOBENI:   As I have already indicated, I 
  can't remember very well, because it is a long time ago.   Initially we never 
  told the Police that we were members of APLA, at the end, in mitigation of sentence, 
  there is a section where we told the Court that our actions were politically 
  motivated, that is where we told the Court that we were members of APLA.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, the question then that 
  remains to be answered is why didn't you if you now are frank and open and put 
  all your cards on the table to spell out exactly what your political motives 
  were at the time, why didn't you explain that in the court of law as well?
MR NGOBENI:   It was very difficult that time, 
  because of our experience how the political people were handled by the government 
  of the National Party, so it was very much difficult for us if they could have 
  known that we were members of APLA, they were going to treat us very badly, 
  just like other people who were killed by the Security Police, more especially 
  in prison.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairperson, 
  I have no further questions.

WITNESS EXCUSED
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbandazayo?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, I will only call 
  one witness, Gen Fihla only on two specific points to give evidence, thank you.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  General Fihla, what are 
  your full names please?

 
MR FIHLA:   Mbulelo Raymond.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mbulelo?
MR FIHLA:   Yes, Raymond Fihla.
MBULELO RAYMOND FIHLA:   (sworn states)
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Mbandazayo?
EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:   Thank you Chairperson.  
  Gen Fihla, can you tell first the Committee where are you presently working, 
  what are you doing at that one?
MR FIHLA:   I am presently with Defence Intelligence, 
  I am part of the collection team under Major General Steenkamp.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Can you tell the Committee 
  your rank?
MR FIHLA:   I am a Brigadier General by rank.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Mr Fihla, can you tell the 
  Committee, before you became a member of the South African National Defence 
  Force, which of the non-statutory forces did you belong to?
MR FIHLA:   I belonged to the Azanian Peoples' 
  Liberation Army and I was a member of the High Command and at that time, Director 
  for Military Intelligence.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Can you Gen Fihla tell the 
  Committee, whether do you know any of the applicants in this hearing?
MR FIHLA:   The only applicant I know directly 
  is Brian Thobejane.  How I know him is because when he arrived, I think it was 
  1990 or 1991, I think I was the one who received him and when he did his basic 
  military training and Intelligence courses, I was also in charge of them as 
  well.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Now, Gen Fihla, briefly, the 
  applicants have testified that they targeted the farm of Mr Swanepoel and the 
  reason why the targeted the farm of Mr Swanepoel is because it was in terms 
  of the PAC APLA policy to attack the farms.  Can you confirm that, can you tell 
  the Committee whether, what they did was within the scope of operations of APLA 
  or it was outside the scope of APLA?
MR FIHLA:   If I recall, I got to know about 
  this operation in 1993 when a report on our casualties was given by the then 
  Director of Operations, Comrade Lethlapa Mpahlela.  Because we all the time 
  had to look at the operations to look if definitely they fell within the ambit 
  and the mandate of the Azanian Peoples' Liberation Army and I can confirm that 
  this operation specifically fell  within the mandate and the ambit of our operations.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   You mention that Lethlapa Mpahlela, 
  former Director of Operations, and you said that when you talk about casualties, 
  can you expand on that?
MR FIHLA:   What we used to do, occasionally 
  reports were given to the High Command and specifically to me as well as the 
  Director for Military Intelligence, to make a review of cases and casualties 
  because part of my responsibilities was to ensure that the same mistakes don't 
  happen again and was to ensure that operations were conducted, they were based 
  on proper intelligence.  That is why specifically also on this operation, I 
  received a report as well.    Lethlapa was given a report in his capacity as 
  Director for Operations, because all operations fell directly under him.  The 
  cadres who were conducting operations directly, were accountable specifically 
  to him.  
MR MBANDAZAYO:   It was also mentioned here, 
  can you elaborate that it was mentioned that there were two, you also had two 
  certain Units within APLA, a Repossession Unit and an Offensive Unit, can you 
  briefly tell the Committee, whether the same Unit can do the same, can be involved 
  - if the Offensive Unit can be involved in the Repossession Unit and the Repossession 
  Unit can be involved in the offensive operations?
MR FIHLA:   Basically the Units were operating 
  separately, they were operating  parallel.  An Offensive Unit was not part of 
  the Repossession Unit, but occasionally it did happen that an Operational Unit 
  would find itself repossessing, maybe this was because of natural factors, because 
  whenever they saw certain things, then they would take some initiative and take 
  some of the things, but the structure was that the Operational Units were separate 
  from Repossession Units.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, that is the evidence 
  I wanted to lead in this aspect from Gen Fihla, thank you.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Mbandazayo.  Mr 
  Van Rensberg, do you have any questions?

 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, 
  thank you Mr Chairman.  General, are you saying that if we make it the policy 
  at the time applicable on these circumstances that you would have expected your 
  Assaulting Unit, if they arrived on the farm, get the farmer into the house, 
  get him to open the safe and there are guns and cash in the safe, you would 
  expect them to take the guns and the cash, is that not so?
MR FIHLA:   We wouldn't expect them to do that, 
  because it was not part of their brief, but it is natural as soldiers, when 
  you see a gun, particularly in our case, on very rare occasions would some of 
  them leave guns idly.  They would definitely maybe take them if the opportunity 
  is there.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, let's put it this way, 
  you would definitely not expect them to leave it there, is it not?
MR FIHLA:   No, I would expect them to leave 
  it there, but if they take the initiative and they deem it fit within their 
  circumstances and they bring them, as long as they report it, that when they 
  conducted this operation, then they had this (indistinct), as long as that was 
  reported and submitted, then they would fall within the mandate, but they would 
  be found guilty if they sustained some casualties because they moved out of 
  the way and started to do what was not within their mandate, that is the problem.  
  So the initiative at times, would be there on the cadres.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, let's narrow it down, 
  it was definitely not against the orders of the attackers in that specific instance, 
  to have taken guns and cash if the opportunity arose?
MR FIHLA:   It would have depended on the instructions 
  of the Commander at that time, who gave them the instructions, what he had said.  
  If they had gone outside the instructions, then they would have been guilty.  
  But it would depend on the instructions of the Commander, depending on the nature 
  of the attack, that was to be attacked.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, but if we talk about 
  the general attitude of the High Command towards such a thing, it would not 
  have been seen as totally strange if they would have taken the guns and the 
  cash?
MR FIHLA:   The policy was strict, that is why 
  we separated the Units, because we didn't want to have confusion in this regard.  
  But from practical experience, occasionally some of the Units did find themselves 
  doing what they were not supposed to do.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, and you as High Command 
  did not have a serious problem with that?
MR FIHLA:   We had a problem with that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you ever discipline those 
  members that took money or guns when they were supposed to kill people?
MR FIHLA:   I remember an instance in the Transkei, 
  fortunately I was there at the time when they reported him, a Unit had gone 
  out of his way to do what he was not supposed to do and I was part of the team 
  that disbanded that Unit because they went out of their way to do what they 
  were not supposed to do, so I can confirm that disciplinary measures were taken 
  when such things came up.  But naturally we would also look at the circumstances 
  under which such activities did take place and then take the necessary measures 
  on the basis of that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, when you started giving 
  your evidence, I got the impression that you would say and speaking on behalf 
  of the High Command, that you would not frown on the cadres if they do take 
  weapons and cash perhaps in those circumstances.  Are you now saying that you 
  actually totally disapproved of that, because of the split in the different 
  disciplines?
MR FIHLA:   I think the words you are using, 
  I did not use them.  Initially I said naturally, because we are dealing with 
  human beings who would at times, take their own initiative, so I am talking 
  from practical experience, from what happened.  Some of the Units did actually 
  do what they were not supposed to do.  We dealt with those cases specifically 
  according to the circumstances under which it happened.  We were strict on this 
  rule, that is why we separated the Units and I am making this example of the 
  Transkei where I was part and parcel of the team that disciplined the Unit there, 
  but naturally which is what I am saying, we looked at the circumstances.  Being 
  a soldier myself, if a weapon is laying idle there and I can carry it, I will 
  not jump it and leave it, because I was not part of the Repossession Unit, so 
  I would take the initiative and take it, as long as I report it back.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, if I can refer you to 
  the statement of the first applicant, Mr Thobejane.
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit A?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, that is Exhibit A, 
  thank you Mr Chairman,  and specifically paragraph 8.2 thereof, I am going to 
  quote it for you, he says, perhaps I should start with yes, 8.2 -
                "... 
  the bastion and minions of the then erstwhile regime were in terms of the APLA 
  perspective (a) the members of the South African Police and reservists in general, 
  (b) members of the South African Police and reservists in general, (c) ..."
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Sorry Chairperson, just a correction 
  there, I think there it was a typographical error, it should be South African 
  Defence Force.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, (b).
MR MBANDAZAYO:   It was a repetition, (b), it 
  was a repetition of paragraph (a).  (b) should be South African Defence Force 
  before it was National Defence Force.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I don't think I will 
  have a problem with that amendment, it clearly refers in (b) to members of the 
  South African Defence Force and then -
                "... 
  (c), the farmers as they belonged to the Commando structures."
        Let's stop 
  the quotation there.  General, if I get the impression then that APLA had it 
  against the regime, the Police, the Defence Force and the white farmers, or 
  the farmers then, who formed part of the Commando's, the only thing that I can 
  think of that qualifies these three to be grouped together is because they were 
  all armed, armed structures, is that not so?
MR FIHLA:   Partly yes, but our understanding 
  was that the farmers who formed the first line of defence through the Commando 
  Unit system and so on.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, and it was general knowledge 
  that farmers are armed?
MR FIHLA:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So with that knowledge if 
  I interpret your evidence correctly, you say that it was APLA's policy or instructions 
  that in fact, in spite of the fact that they attacked armed farmers, if they 
  come across guns, they should leave it there and not disarm the farmers because 
  it is not part of that Unit's responsibility, is that your evidence?
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Van Rensberg, I understood 
  it, and correct me if I am wrong please, was that the Offensive Unit's function 
  was to attack, not to repossess.  Repossession Unit's function essentially was 
  to repossess, but if in an attack conducted by an Offensive Unit, they came 
  across weapons or money and they could use their discretion and take that money, 
  so long as they reported it to the Operations Director, etc, that was the understanding 
  I took, so in other words and I think in the last answer that the General answered, 
  he said if he was as a soldier doing an attack and came across a gun, he would 
  himself have taken it and then, but report it.  I think that was the understanding, 
  if there wasn't an order "leave guns alone."
MR VAN RENSBERG:   It should be totally separate.
CHAIRPERSON:   Just rephrase the question.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.  
  Perhaps I did misunderstand it, I thought, I also thought that was initially 
  his view, but then that he changed later, perhaps I can put a specific statement 
  to him.
CHAIRPERSON:   Before I put that, was I incorrect 
  in what I said?
MR FIHLA:   You are correct, that is what I 
  said.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Okay, then we should not 
  need to take the matter further.  If you then accept as correct the statement 
  that the Chairman has made just now, then obviously you have to agree with me 
  that the Court, the criminal Court made the correct ruling in finding them guilty 
  on attempted robbery, do you agree with that statement?
MR FIHLA:   Unfortunately I did not see the 
  Court ruling and I am not too sure if that ruling was based on what, so I wouldn't 
  commit myself on that one.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I see.  The Chairman previously 
  enlightened us to the fact that on the 16th of January 1994, APLA stopped its 
  armed offensive.
CHAIRPERSON:   I said I think it was the 16th, 
  I wasn't sure of the date.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   That is correct.
MR FIHLA:   It is correct, the 16th.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I just want to confirm 
  that, is that in fact the correct date that we are talking about, 16th of January 
  1994?
MR FIHLA:   I am not too sure about the date, 
  but it was in January 1994.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Have you as part, or at least 
  former part of APLA's High Command, what steps have you taken to make sure that 
  your cadres on the ground today, has received that orders?
MR FIHLA:   This decision was taken in 1994 
  and I was part of the decision, the reason why the decision was taken first 
  and foremost is because at that time, if I may give you the background of the 
  PAC, there was some divisions in terms of whether the PAC should become part 
  and parcel of the process that was taking place at the time.  After a lengthy 
  debate a decision eventually was taken in January that the armed struggle has 
  got to be stopped and therefore both the PAC and APLA had to be part and parcel 
  of the process that was taking place.  Instructions were issued by the High 
  Command, unfortunately we had a long structure in terms of the chain of command, 
  so the instructions from the High Command were directed first and foremost to 
  the Director of Operations, and the Director of Operations in turn had to give 
  instructions to the Regional Commanders and the Regional Commanders in turn 
  had to give instructions to the District Commanders, down until it reached the 
  lowest levels, and this took a long time.  Not necessarily because it was a 
  long chain, but secondly we had to convince our cadres, like I am indicating 
  that we had serious divisions in this regard.  Even ourselves before we could 
  take that decision as the High Command, we were seriously divided, we had to 
  debate over the issue until finally we had the majority that was for the decision, 
  and amongst the cadres as well, there were those initially who opposed it and 
  this opposition was also reflected later on when we integrated into the Defence 
  Force.  Some of the members refused to integrate and we had to persuade them 
  and the last group was only integrated last year, we are still continuing to 
  make an effort to make sure that even those who have not yet integrated, must 
  become part and parcel of the process.  I can assure you that we have made an 
  effort since 1994, even to date, if we can get an indication possibly that there 
  are some APLA members that are thinking differently from what the High Command 
  thought and the PAC thought initially, we will take it upon ourselves to make 
  sure that they tow the line.
CHAIRPERSON:   General, APLA, does it still 
  exist?
MR FIHLA:   APLA still exists in as far as integration 
  is concerned.
CHAIRPERSON:   But it doesn't have its formal 
  structures in place, etc?
MR FIHLA:   No, that structure is now part and 
  parcel of the Defence Force.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.
MR FIHLA:   But within the Defence Force, we 
  still remain an entity to make sure that everything that pertains to APLA is 
  addressed.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   You no longer have the Offensive, 
  the Repossession and the other Units?
MR FIHLA:   Not at all, we are part and parcel 
  of the government structures now, members of the Defence Force.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Thank you.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, you have heard the evidence 
  of the applicants, I think it was the first applicant who said that, or at least 
  implied that he never got that instruction because he was in jail at the time.  
  The question is what are you, or what have you done, what are you doing to make 
  sure that the people who are still in jail and many of them are perhaps now 
  making application for amnesty, that they have received the orders to stop the 
  armed struggle?
MR FIHLA:   We made a lot of effort, even we 
  went to an extent of visiting some of the members who were in prison as well 
  including the applicants themselves, I think I have been in contact with the 
  first applicant as well, even as late as when was it, last week, if I am not 
  mistaken, so we have made an effort to make sure that we get into contact with 
  all former APLA members wherever they are.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Are you saying that you, 
  yourself, gave the order to the first applicant that the war is over now?
MR FIHLA:   I didn't, because I was not directly 
  responsible for him.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   If I understand your evidence 
  correctly, you said you never had any knowledge of this specific attack that 
  we are talking about, until after it had already happened?
MR FIHLA:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   That definitely was not the 
  case with Mr Mpahlela, is that not so, he knew about the attack?
MR FIHLA:   It was, it was the case as well, 
  because Mr Mpahlela was not a Regional Commander, he was a Director of all Operations. 
   Regional Commanders were reporting to him and telling him what they intended 
  to do, and his responsibility was to ensure that those operations fell within 
  the mandate and guidelines of APLA and the PAC.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I see, so Mr Lethlapa Mpahlela 
  did know about this attack?
MR FIHLA:   He did know about the attack yes, 
  because he gave the authority to go ahead.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know if Mr Mpahlela 
  has made application for amnesty?
MR FIHLA:   I am not too sure whether he has 
  finally did it for this one specifically but I know that he did apply for a 
  number of other operations were he was directly involved, but in terms of this 
  one specifically, I am not too sure.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know what position 
  Mr Mpahlela is holding at the moment?
MR FIHLA:   Mr Mpahlela has not integrated, 
  he is in the PAC.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is he a politician, still 
  a politician?
MR FIHLA:   Yes, but he doesn't hold any post 
  within the PAC.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I see.  Just a last question, 
  may I ask if you yourself, has made application for amnesty?
MR FIHLA:   I did make an application for amnesty 
  and it was turned down.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I see.  No further questions, 
  thank you Mr Chairman.

WITNESS EXCUSED
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbandazayo?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Thank you Mr Chairperson and 
  Honourable members of the Committee, that is the evidence of the applicants.  
  That concludes the evidence of the applicants, thank you.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Van Rensberg?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  At 
  this stage we are ready to proceed to lead the evidence of the victim, it will 
  only be one witness, Mr Swanepoel.  I don't know if you want us to proceed?
CHAIRPERSON:   We could have the evidence now 
  if possible, thank you.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Swanepoel will give evidence 
  in  ... (mechanical problem) ...

 
MR SWANEPOEL:   ... on the Ganula smallholdings.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   All right, let us start, 
  on the 27th of April 1993, APLA launched an attack on your farm, is that correct?
MR SWANEPOEL:   It was the 28th of April 1993.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   28th of April, could you 
  please tell the Commission what happened from that morning when you got up?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I got up at about five o'clock 
  in the morning and I had a shower, I opened some of the windows in the house, 
  I opened the back door and the front door and I made tea and took my wife some 
  tea in the bedroom.  We were sitting on the bed - may I just go back a little 
  bit, early that morning, just before I got up, the one dog who sleeps in the 
  bedroom with us, there are two who sleeps in the bedroom, one dog rushed to 
  the window and barked.  I got up and I went to have a look, but I didn't see 
  anything.  Then later, I got up and washed and took my wife some tea in bed 
  and while we were drinking tea, I was sitting on her side of the bed, and I 
  looked out in the direction of which I would leave the house, I had already 
  put on my socks and shoes and I was weighing medicine for the chickens and I 
  then left the house, it was about quarter past six in the morning.  In each 
  hand, I carried a little bowl of medication and approximately 15 metres from 
  the front door, I heard a muttering.  There was a cement pond surrounded by 
  flowers and I saw man standing, jumping up from the flowers and I actually thought 
  it was one of my own labourers and I wondered why he was up so early, what he 
  was doing on our property so early because it wasn't yet time for work.  I open 
  up the cages first thing in the morning and only then do the labourers arrive 
  and the man approached me and said that I should halt.  As he approached me,  
  Mr Thobejane also jumped up amongst the flower bed and when the first man was 
  about five metres away from me, he aimed a pistol at me and when Mr Thobejane 
  stood up, I saw that he had an AK47.  I then stood still, I first wanted to 
  run and then the person with the pistol said I should stand still.  As I was 
  still thinking what I was about to do, I took the two bowls of medicine and 
  I bent forward and put it down on the path in front of me, he once again told 
  me to stand still.  He then told me to go back to the house and he pushed the 
  pistol in the small of my back and we turned around and walked towards the house.  
  Mr Thobejane walked next to us with the AK47 aimed at the dog, I have a Staffordshire 
  Terrier dog who stays outside the house on the smallholding, and he kept this 
  weapon aimed at the dog.  At the door, the person with the pistol led me in 
  the direction of the room, we first entered into an entrance hall, we then turned 
  right into a passage and at the end of the passage, on the right hand side, 
  is the main bedroom.  When I got to the bedroom door, I saw my wife standing 
  in the middle of the room and I knew I had to do something.  I then jumped into 
  the room, and as I did so, I slammed the door shut, but as I did so, I heard 
  a shot go off and it missed me by millimetres, it missed my arm.  As the door 
  banged shut, my wife onto the floor in front of me.  I knew that she was dead.  
  I stepped over her, I stepped over her body and went to my safe because I knew 
  that this was trouble.  Whilst I was standing in front of the safe to unlock 
  it, shots were fired at me through the window from outside.  By the time I got 
  my weapon out of the safe, I heard people shouting at each other outside and 
  then there was quiet.  I first looked out of the window to make sure if there 
  was anybody outside, there was nobody and then I went out, I left the house 
  and there was nobody outside.  
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So were shots fired from 
  outside into the bedroom?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, one narrowly missed my 
  leg by about 100 millimetres and went into the wardrobe and one missed my head 
  by about 50 millimetres and went into the wall.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you then summon the Police 
  after that?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, a minute or so afterwards 
  my phone rang and it was the neighbour, she was outside and she said that she 
  could hear shots and what was going on.  I told her that we were attacked and 
  that my wife was dead and I said to her "please just get the Police."
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Earlier today we heard evidence 
  that the applicants were of the opinion that your wife was actually busy summoning 
  help by telephone, can you respond to that?
MR SWANEPOEL:   There is no phone in the bedroom 
  and I didn't also have a mobile phone.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At the time the shot was 
  fired which hit Mrs Swanepoel, was she armed?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, she had her pistol in her 
  hand, there was only one round in the chamber.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The evidence thus far has 
  pointed out that Mrs Swanepoel shot at the attackers?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, that could not have been 
  because I was actually between her and the attackers in the room, in the door 
  to the bedroom.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   The evidence of Mr Thobejane 
  was that you locked yourself in the bedroom and that he couldn't open the door 
  and that is also contained in the affidavit which was handed in as Exhibit 
  A, could you respond to that?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, that is not true.  I slammed 
  the door shut and immediately went to my safe.  If I still had to lock the door, 
  the person who had been shooting at me, as I was standing in front of the safe, 
  how would he have been able to shoot at me if I had locked the bedroom door.  
  It all happened so quickly as Mr Thobejane said, it happened so very quickly.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know who it was who 
  fired the shot at your wife?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I think, I am assuming it was 
  the man with the pistol because there was a cartridge, a bullet, the cartridge 
  of that, was found in the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So that must have been the 
  deceased Modau?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You have already said that 
  you are a chicken farmer, what was in the safe at that stage, at the stage when 
  the attack on your house was carried out?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Weapons and cash.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What kind of weapons and 
  how much cash?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I had three long rifles and 
  about R15 000 in cash.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Did you have the impression 
  that the attackers had forced you into the bedroom?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, because the person had 
  pushed the pistol into my back and had led me to the room like that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Please tell the Commission 
  what is your view as to why they did this?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I can only imagine that they 
  wanted to commit a robbery because if they wanted to kill me, why didn't they 
  do that earlier?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Were any words uttered by 
  any of the attackers, did they say for instance that they were looking for weapons 
  or cash?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Was there anything which 
  had prevented or would have prevented the attackers from killing you if that 
  was their intention?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, nothing.  Because as I have 
  already mentioned, if they had wanted to kill me, then they could have done 
  so earlier that morning when they were at the window and for instance when they 
  led me back into the house, they had opportunity to do so.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   So, if I make the correct 
  inference from your evidence, you agree with the finding of the Criminal Court 
  that they were also guilty of an attempted robbery?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   And it is largely as a result 
  of your evidence and the surrounding circumstances on the basis of which the 
  Criminal Court came to such a finding?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You heard and it also appears 
  from the affidavits of specifically the first applicant and also his evidence 
  and also the other statements forming part of the Bundle, that the attackers 
  had certain information that your home was the regular meeting point for right 
  wing people, people who had right wing political convictions in the first place 
  and secondly that you were a member of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, Afrikaner 
  Resistance Movement and also that you didn't like black people, what do you 
  say about this?
MR SWANEPOEL:   This is totally untrue.  I have 
  no links with any political bodies and my business is exclusively done with 
  black people and I wouldn't allow my business to suffer by such things.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Let's talk about the effect 
  that this attack had on your business, could you tell us?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I had to cancel my order, the 
  next order of chickens immediately because I was alone and I had to make all 
  the arrangements for the funeral and everything and from then onwards, my sales 
  just declined because black people told me that they were now scared, after 
  what had happened and since then, my business actually plummeted by about half.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You actually suffered financial 
  loss as a result of this?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   At the time of the attack, 
  did you still have children at school and in your care?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, I had a son who was in 
  standard 9, he was at boarding school in Tzaneen.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Could you perhaps tell us 
  what the effect was of wife's death on this son of yours?
MR SWANEPOEL:   He blamed me, he blamed me for 
  not stopping these people, he was very close to his mother, he was the youngest 
  child still at home and that evening, he slit his wrists and two years later, 
  also on the 28th of April, he took his own life.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Would one then be correct 
  in inferring that your son could never actually deal with this attack?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, he never could.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Swanepoel, would you like 
  to have a short break?
MR SWANEPOEL:   It is all right.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Mr Swanepoel, what is your 
  feeling today about the applicants who testified here today?  I would like you 
  to tell the Commission specifically whether you have any fear for the future 
  if they succeed in their application for amnesty?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I certainly have a fear because 
  firstly I am still continuing with the business and it is possible at any time 
  that they can come back to finish what they had started.  Whether I oppose the 
  application for amnesty or not, I think they will definitely come back.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do I understand you correctly 
  if you say that you don't believe that the only motivation for the attack on 
  yourself as a target was as the applicants had testified, that it was purely 
  for political reasons?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, I believe that.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is there anything that you 
  would like to add to your evidence?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I may just mention that about 
  two weeks after the attack took place, I think it was about two weeks, two or 
  three weeks, I was summoned by the Security Police to Tzaneen, they told me 
  they couldn't speak to me over the phone, I had to come and see them personally 
  and they asked me whether I couldn't perhaps stop my business activities in 
  that area because a certain Mr Baloyi, Jameson Baloyi, had told the Security 
  Police that if I don't cease my business operations in that area, that he would 
  take  me out of that area.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Is that information given 
  to you by the Security Police?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Do you know this Mr Jameson 
  Baloyi?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, not at all.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You heard the evidence before 
  the Commission that Jameson Baloyi was one of the people who gave shelter to 
  some of the attackers?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What is your reaction to 
  that and what is your attitude towards Mr Baloyi's threat?
MR SWANEPOEL:   One thing I can't understand 
  is why has it never been mentioned in any case, if this man can utter such a 
  threat and this is known the Police, I can't understand what would stop him 
  from carrying this threat or his activities.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Just two final aspects.  
  You have heard the evidence of the first applicant, that when you came out of 
  the house on that morning, that you had a firearm in your hand?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, that is totally untrue.  
  It was only my wife who had a pistol and there is no other pistol in our house, 
  or there wasn't.  They said that she had the pistol in the house, so there is 
  no way that I could have had the pistol with me as I left the house.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   You were present during the 
  criminal trial of the applicants after you had testified, is that correct?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   My question is this, today 
  we heard that the attack was planned and executed against you purely as a result 
  of a political motive.  Did this political motivation, was this raised at all 
  during the criminal trial before conviction?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, not once.  It was only mentioned 
  after they had been convicted and before sentence, then they said that it was 
  politically inspired.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   What is the inference that 
  you draw from that?
MR SWANEPOEL:   I say it wasn't politically 
  inspired, it was murder and robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Thank you Chair, no further 
  questions.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBERG
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any cross-examination 
  Mr Mbandazayo?

 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, 
  I don't think I have much except I would like to say to Mr Swanepoel, accept 
  my condolences for the loss of your wife and the pain which you went through 
  during this incident.   Mr Chairperson, I would not like to take him through 
  all this, I can see that he is still in grief whenever (indistinct), but I would 
  like to ask one question, it relates to the trial.  Do you agree with me that 
  at the trial they denied that they were ever involved in the incident, the applicants, 
  they denied that they were ever involved before conviction?  It was their defence 
  that they were never involved in that incident?
ADV BOSMAN:   Mr Swanepoel, Mr Mbandazayo is 
  putting it to you that during the defence case they denied that they were ever 
  involved in this case and he asks whether you agree with that?
MR SWANEPOEL:   With the attack that was launched?
ADV BOSMAN:   Let me explain to you, in a criminal 
  case there are two sections, two parts.  Firstly you have the evidence which 
  is led, the State leads evidence and the Defence also leads evidence and after 
  conviction then there is evidence in mitigation of sentence and Mr Mbandazayo 
  is putting it to you that during this first phase, in other words before conviction, 
  the applicants denied any involvement in this incident.  Do you agree that this 
  is what happened?
MR SWANEPOEL:   In the first part, well that 
  dealt with their detention and how they had been assaulted, that is what the 
  first part dealt with.
ADV BOSMAN:   So you agree that it was only 
  during mitigation of sentence that they conceded that they had been involved?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Thank you.  Thank you Adv Bosman.  
  What you gathered is that what they wanted was to escape any conviction for 
  that incident during the trial?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, I presume so.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   You also mentioned that you 
  fear that they might come back and finish what they started and you also mentioned 
  that Jameson Baloyi made a threat.  Am I correct to say that since 1993, it 
  was two weeks after the incident, no attack was ever carried against you again 
  despite Mr Baloyi being out, free?
MR SWANEPOEL:   Yes, there was no attempt, but 
  what I was saying once they get amnesty and they are out, won't they carry on 
  with the act that they were busy with?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   You have heard what they said 
  before the Committee, that what they did was politically motivated and that 
  now they are part and parcel of the new dispensation and that the organisation 
  to which they belong, which is part of the government and also APLA has integrated, 
  is not that enough to allay your fears?
MR SWANEPOEL:   No, not for me.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   I have no further questions 
  Chairperson, thank you.

  thank you.

 
COMMITTEE ADJOURNS
ON RESUMPTION:
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbandazayo, have you got any 
  submissions to make?
MR MBANDAZAYO IN ARGUMENT:   Yes Chairperson.  
  Chairperson, I wouldn't like to bore you with the requirements of the Act, going 
  through the requirements of the Act, suffice to say that it is my submission 
  on behalf of the applicants that they have met the requirements of Section 20(1) 
  and (2), that they were quite clearly acting on behalf of APLA, a publicly known 
  political organisation and a liberation movement which was engaged in a political 
  struggle against the State at that time.
        I also submit 
  that the applicants did not act for personal gain or out of personal malice, 
  ill-will or spite against the deceased and the victims.  It is quite clear that 
  they had no personal knowledge except to know that the farm belonged to him, 
  and that they had merely gone there on behalf of the organisation.  Chairperson, 
  I would deal with the evidence briefly of the first applicant.  The first applicant 
  put it clearly that the Commander and the second applicant, Donald, made reconnaissance 
  and they came with the information that the place is frequented by right right-wingers 
  because they went there to do reconnaissance for their attack.  More above the 
  fact that they were also the farmers in terms of the APLA and PAC policies, 
  they were the targets, but they had this additional information that also it 
  is frequented by right right-wingers.   It is clear that, it is not because 
  they went to attack there because it was frequented by right right-wingers, 
  they went to attack because it was within their policy to attack farmers.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think also from what 
  I gathered although it wasn't specifically said was that that sort of information 
  was obtained from interviewing workers, etc, so that information might merely 
  be the opinion of a worker and as such, it could be quite incorrect.  It might 
  have been frequented by people, but whether they were right right-wingers or 
  not, was the opinion of the person supplying the information to the Recce team, 
  but I take your point, you are saying that even if they didn't have that information, 
  they would have attacked.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Yes Chairperson, in any event, 
  that was additional information which they had, which might not be correct Chairperson, 
  but the fact is that they did not go to attack because it was frequented by 
  right right-wingers, but it was information they gathered when they went to 
  do, to make reconnaissance for their attack.  Of course definitely they would 
  not just go there and attack, they have to look at everything, whether it is 
  possible for them to be able to come back safe and all those things.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because I think on the evidence 
  before us, we are certainly not in a position to find that it was frequented 
  by right right-wingers, particularly in the light of Mr Swanepoel's evidence 
  who says he wasn't politically affiliated.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Yes Chairperson, I agree with 
  you fully that there is no concrete evidence that it was frequented by right 
  right-wingers, but as I put it that it was not the case that the attack was 
  because it was frequented by right right-wingers.  Chairperson, coming to the 
  - and also Chairperson, all the people in line of command, Lethlapa Mpahlela 
  who gave authority, I need not go to that, the Committee knows about Lethlapa 
  Mpahlela, his role within APLA and it has been confirmed by Gen Fihla that it 
  came to their knowledge after this incident.
        Chairperson, 
  coming to the evidence, Chairperson, I wouldn't like to put my neck on the block 
  on what happened, but I would like the Committee to take into account the events 
  of that day, that this incident happened almost six years ago, if my calculations 
  are correct, 1993, and everything happened very quickly.  Chairperson, I need 
  not preach to you, all of you, you are experienced more than myself, all of 
  us we can witness one incident here, but if we are called upon to narrate, you 
  will doubt that other people were present when this happened.  Not necessarily 
  because they are lying, but it is always the human factor, I don't know, I wouldn't 
  like to say what is the reason, but that is my experience. 
        What I am 
  trying to say is that there might be some discrepancies as to what actually 
  happened actually there, but the fact is the applicants, they are saying "yes, 
  we did it, it was us, we went there.  We committed this offence."
ADV BOSMAN:   Mr Mbandazayo, I think the question 
  is whether all of these discrepancies are of a material nature.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Yes Chairperson, through you 
  Chairperson, I am just going there Chairperson, that definitely it is my submission 
  that the discrepancies which are there, are not of material nature that the 
  Chairperson would see that they are make or break.  Those are minor discrepancies 
  with regard for instance if I may take the evidence of Mr Swanepoel, taking 
  into account the situation in which he was, terrified, pointed with a gun, also 
  definitely the Committee have to take into account his observation would be 
  at least, definitely somebody in his position won't be to be able to say that 
  the applicant, especially the first applicant, that he was the person who was 
  pointed, except to say that because the applicant has admitted that he is the 
  person who was carrying an AK47.  For instance if I can take to, it was not 
  disputed though he disputed in his evidence that the shooting, the Commander 
  went outside, on the outside window, there was a shooting and then he came back 
  inside the house and also there was a shooting with the wife of the applicant.
        If one takes 
  that into account, it may not have been disputed because the victim was going 
  to testify, but if one takes that into account, one would come to what I have 
  already said that it is always the human factor, not necessary even to say, 
  I am not saying Mr Swanepoel is lying, what I am saying it is how he recollects 
  the events of the day and which is the same with the applicants, it is how they 
  recollect the events of the day as to how it happened.  It is therefore Chairperson, 
  my submission that the differences in what happened on that day in question 
  exactly in the house, as whether they shot whilst Mr Swanepoel was running inside 
  the house and trying to close the door and whether he was shot before he went 
  inside the house.  What I am trying to say is that the fact of the matter is 
  and it is not disputed that the deceased was shot with a pistol, she was not 
  shot with an AK47 and the person who was carrying a pistol, was the Commander, 
  Prince and that the first applicant was carrying an AK47.  That Chairperson, 
  I think is very important.  I would understand it if the victim, it would say 
  it was material if the applicant was saying that he was shot with a pistol, 
  whilst he was shot with an AK47.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you are saying is these 
  discrepancies, none of them can lead one to deduce that the applicants were 
  playing down any role that they might have played?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Exactly Chairperson, because 
  it remains ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are saying if he was 
  armed with the pistol and then said he was shot with an AK47, which was found 
  to be incorrect, then one could arrive at the conclusion that he intentionally 
  made that statement to protect or lessen his liability, but that is not the 
  case with these discrepancies?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   On both versions it seems clear 
  that the bullet was fired from a pistol and that Modau had the pistol?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Yes Chairperson, and also Chairperson, 
  it would have been easy for the applicant to say look, "I did not even 
  attempt to kill Mr Swanepoel".  On his own he said "my firearm jammed, 
  I wanted to kill him when he was running."  It was easy for him because 
  nobody knows, to say, "look, I did not even attempt to do anything" 
  and it is my submission Chairperson, that taking into account the events and 
  what has been said to this Committee even by Gen Fihla, it is clear that their 
  motive was to attack Chairperson.  If they went there for robbery, it is my 
  submission that I don't see any reason for them not to shoot their way through 
  that door, and go and take whatever they wanted to take, if that was the case.
        And also 
  Chairperson, the fact that the deceased had a firearm, it is clear though Mr 
  Swanepoel said the safe was locked, one - unfortunately, I didn't want to take 
  him through the events of the day because I could see that it is taking him 
  back, but it is clear that definitely I suppose that also the firearm of the 
  wife was kept in a safe, and it will be my submission that definitely, I don't 
  think at that time, it was locked, the safe, as it was put here that he was 
  trying to open the safe at that time.  I am not trying to say that he is lying, 
  but I what I am trying to say is that this all revolves around the fact that 
  it is a human factor, because things happened a long time ago and all this happened 
  fast.  Therefore Chairperson, it is my humble submission taking into account 
  the previous decisions of the Committee, not necessarily this Committee on some 
  of the issues involving farm attacks, which one I would quote, the Dannyside 
  Farm which happened on 19 November 1992, it happened when Adv Bosman was involved 
  in East London, which somebody, Mrs - Leon Pretorius died as a result of APLA 
  attacks on the farm which of course was spelt out it was the policy.  
        Chairperson 
  without boring you, it is my submission that the applicants have made their 
  case in respect of the requirements of the Act and that on that basis, it is 
  therefore my humble submission that they should be granted amnesty as applied 
  by them.  Chairperson, unless the Committee wants me to address it on any specific 
  issue?
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Mbandazayo.  Mr 
  Van Rensberg?

 
MR VAN RENSBERG IN ARGUMENT:   Thank you Mr 
  Chairman.   Mr Chairman, from the time that the applicants completed their applications 
  for amnesty, they have consistently stuck to the story that the attack on the 
  farm was politically motivated.  That version was repeated here today and I 
  have to admit, in spite of cross-examination, they have stuck to their story.  
  That however, is not the end of the story.  There are a number of factors which 
  actually point to this attack being or the motivation for the attack, being 
  personal gain in the form of robbery.  To mention a few, these persons all the 
  applicants, were convicted of attempted robbery and they were convicted on the 
  evidence of the victim, Mr Swanepoel who related obviously to the Court the 
  circumstances surrounding the assault on the farm.  The only one which was there, 
  except for the applicants, was Mr Swanepoel.  He himself today, has again reiterated 
  the fact that in his personal opinion, he is of the opinion that the motivation 
  for the attack was in fact robbery.   It is strange that this political motivation 
  was not raised during the defence of the applicants, the defence of the applicants 
  during the criminal trial.  
        At this stage 
  further, we've got to accept that ...
CHAIRPERSON:   It wouldn't have been a defence, 
  would it?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, it wouldn't have been 
  a defence, I have to concede that Mr Chairman, but we have seen the attitude 
  of the applicants.  I got the impression that they were quite, let's put it 
  this way, that they are not ashamed of what they had done, that they did it 
  not for themselves, but in spite of that fact, they elected not to use that 
  beliefs or the strength of the belief ...
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what is quite clear, 
  what must have happened at the trial was they first stated, from the answer 
  given by Mr Swanepoel, that they weren't there, they denied that they took part 
  in the robbery?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   The whole first portion of the 
  trial up to conviction was relating to what seemed probably voluntary assaults 
  relating to confessions and so they were then endeavouring not to get convicted, 
  it is very common in very many criminal cases, I am sure you are aware of it, 
  then as soon as they are convicted, they raise the political motivation?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, that I have to concede.
CHAIRPERSON:   In mitigation of sentence.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   I have to concede, except 
  to say that it, if they did raise the defence of political motivation, that 
  would have perhaps cleared them on the charge of attempted robbery.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   No, but if they had admitted 
  to having committed any of the offences at all, because once you admit on the 
  attempted robbery, then you've got to admit on the other offences as well, so 
  if they had made any admission, they wouldn't have been able to escape criminal 
  liability, don't you agree?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I agree with that, yes.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   So once they were convicted, 
  they were left with no option but then to try in mitigation of sentence and 
  come out with the political nature of what they had now been convicted of.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, I have to concede that 
  that is a possibility, but the other possibility is of course that that fact 
  was only dreamt up afterwards and it was put in their heads afterwards, after 
  they had been convicted?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   That was generally the case 
  Mr Van Rensberg, people will try and escape liability.  I am not saying this 
  was politically motivated, but in instances where people had been acting on 
  behalf of these liberation movements, they wouldn't admit the fact that they 
  had been acting on behalf of their various armed formations, on behalf of the 
  various liberation movements, because that would have entailed having to admit 
  to the commission of a particular offence.  They always wanted to escape criminal 
  liability.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Also it gets, I suppose one could 
  write an article on it, but not knowing what the evidence was at that trial, 
  a group of people go into a house armed with guns, shoot people, a person gets 
  killed, they get arrested, they get charged with murder, attempted murder, attempted 
  robbery, they get convicted of murder and attempted murder and attempted robbery, 
  now what - if I am robbing you and I hit you over the head and take your wallet, 
  I don't get convicted of assaulting you and of robbery, because the hitting 
  over the head is part of the robbery.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Now wasn't the whole attack on 
  the farmhouse, part of the robbery, in other words was that attempted robbery, 
  is it not a type of duplication of charges?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Of conviction?  
ADV BOSMAN:   Mr Van Rensberg, I just want to 
  add this to what my two colleagues have said, if you look at the totality of 
  the evidence, surely the fact that they had Chinese stick grenades, the nature 
  of the weapons that they had with them and the evidence of Gen Fihla, if you 
  look at all that, surely that is certainly not inconsistent with the fact that 
  they were political activists and if you accept that they were political activists, 
  would you then still argue strongly that this defence or rather the facts raised 
  in mitigation, are not consistent ...
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, Mr Chairperson, I am 
  afraid I still have to argue that point on the basis that if we are to believe 
  the applicants, then the reason why they went to the farm was to kill the occupants 
  of the farm and as Mr Swanepoel testified, there was actually nothing that stopped 
  them from actually killing him.  From that I deduct that it was possibly not 
  the motivation of these assailants to actually kill these people and that is 
  why I deduct that there must have been another purpose to the attack.  I am 
  not prepared to argue this point much further and I leave it to the discretion 
  of the Committee.  
        May I just 
  add another few factors which I consider to be pointers in the support of my 
  theory that they in fact went there to rob the place namely the fact that at 
  this stage the Committee have to accept that there is absolutely no basis on 
  which they identified the target being a political target.  Mr Swanepoel testified 
  that he had actually no political affiliations, that he was definitely not a 
  member of the AWB and that it was actually his livelihood to trade with black 
  persons.  He definitely did not hate them.  If that motivation is then negated, 
  it only leaves one other possibility and that is the fact that he was a farmer, 
  a chicken farmer and I would suggest that it was then common knowledge that 
  he would have guns and a large amount of cash on the farm. 
        Secondly, 
  Mr Swanepoel's evidence was quite direct on the point that they directed him 
  to the bedroom where the safe was located.  He did not walk in that direction 
  voluntarily.  This points to the indication that the assailants, the applicants, 
  had prior knowledge of where the guns and the cash would be kept in that house.  
  I want to step off from that specific point and come to my learned friend's 
  argument that there was no material discrepancies between the versions of the 
  applicants.  Unfortunately Mr Chairman, I cannot accept that suggestion.  I 
  am of the opinion that at least for Mr Thobejane's part, I got the impression 
  that he tried to make the case against him, or his involvement in that, in fact 
  as little as possible.  He fabricated a gun to be in the possession of the farmer 
  when he walked out of the house.  I think there can be little doubt that there 
  was no gun at that stage.  He tried to put as much distance between himself 
  and the person who actually killed Mrs Swanepoel, he said he was preoccupied 
  by trying to shoot Mr Swanepoel in the circumstances, but had to concede that 
  it actually took place in the very same room, there was no different running 
  away and shooting.  The two assailants were next to each other at the entrance 
  of that specific main bedroom, that is the evidence of Mr Swanepoel and again, 
  Mr Swanepoel testified, there was absolutely no reason why they did not actually 
  carry out their, or why they couldn't carry out their mission, namely to shoot 
  the both of them.  
        To sum up 
  therefore, I would suggest that there was in fact attempts from the witness, 
  specifically Mr Thobejane, not to put the real evidence before this forum, that 
  he in fact in that sense, failed to make a full disclosure.  Also referring 
  to the involvement of a certain Jameson Baloyi which he admitted at a very late 
  stage, and under cross-examination to be one of the persons harbouring these 
  assailants.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   What has that to do with regard 
  to the offences for which they are seeking amnesty, the harbouring by Mr Jameson 
  Baloyi?  He did not participate in the murder of Mrs Swanepoel,  nor the attempted 
  murder of Mr Swanepoel?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Well, at the time he was 
  at least harbouring and hiding these assailants which was an offence at the 
  time.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes, he merely gave them accommodation. 
   To them, that was not an offence?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson.  
  The last aspect I want to address you on is the point that was raised earlier 
  during my cross-examination with Mr Thobejane and that is the fact that he consequently 
  omitted to bring the fact that he was in fact convicted for attempted robbery, 
  under the attention, or to the attention of this Committee.  If we look at his 
  application, and specifically paragraph 9(a) thereof, it was required of the 
  applicant to furnish sufficient particulars of the acts, omissions or offences 
  associated with a political objective in respect of which amnesty is sought 
  and at (i) he then stipulated murder, attempted murder, possession of explosives, 
  possession of arms, possession of ammunition, the attempted robbery is specifically 
  excluded there from.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Isn't it included under "etc"?
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is not in 9.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Are you dealing with 9(a)?  
  Yes?
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, from 9(a), obviously 
  there is no mention of "etc".  If we can turn to the specific paragraph 
  that you are referring to, it is paragraph 12(e), the question is "if prosecution 
  followed, state (e) the offence in respect of which found guilty and sentenced, 
  if applicable".  There he listed murder, attempted murder, possession of 
  ammunition, possession of machine guns, possession of explosives, possession 
  of pistol, etc.  I am firmly of the belief Mr Chairperson, that that etc, can 
  in no way cover him for his, or can be interpreted to include his application 
  for amnesty for attempted robbery as well.
CHAIRPERSON:   But he doesn't apply for attempted 
  robbery?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   He is not applying.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, that is so.
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean and when you questioned 
  him on it, he said that well, there wasn't any robbery, they never had any intention 
  etc, but my impression is well, he hasn't applied for it.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes, that is exactly the 
  point I am trying to make.  If I understand the member of the Committee's question 
  correctly, it can perhaps be read, the "etc" can be interpreted to 
  include armed robbery and it is that question that I am addressing now.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   That has nothing to do with 
  the acts for which amnesty is being sought for by the applicant, Mr Thobejane.
MR VAN RENSBERG:   Yes.  To close off then the 
  point that I am trying to make is that at least for the count of attempted robbery, 
  Mr Thobejane has not made application for amnesty and it is therefore not within 
  the powers of this Committee to grant him amnesty for that specific offence.  
  Thank you very much.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Van Rensberg.  Ms 
  Mtanga?
MS MTANGA:   Chairperson, I will leave this 
  matter in your hands.
CHAIRPERSON:   Any reply Mr Mbandazayo?

 
MR MBANDAZAYO IN REPLY:   Yes Chairperson, just 
  briefly.  Chairperson, I think I will start with the question of the gun.  I 
  think Mr Thobejane made it clear that for instance he was not sure about what 
  it was, because he thought, the other, that it was a camera and it is clear 
  from what he told the Committee that the dogs were barking, so definitely though 
  he did not put it in so many words, he expected Mr Swanepoel to come up with 
  a gun and in fact he saw a gun.  Under cross-examination he admitted that he 
  won't dispute that it was not a gun.  So definitely if he was fabricating that, 
  he would have stuck it out and said "look, I don't care who says what, 
  he was carrying a gun."
        Coming to 
  the question of that, Chairperson, I would not go to the question that they 
  did not make out the question of political motivation because Mr Swanepoel was 
  not a right-winger, he was not belonging to any political organisation, it has 
  been stressed that irrespective of what, the farmers were the targets.  Chairperson, 
  I would like to come to this question of armed robbery.  I am sure I would be 
  seen to be monotonous to the Committee, I have been arguing this question, the 
  application in respect of the applicants.   It is always you find that most 
  of the time these people make them in jail and they don't understand the whole 
  procedure of the court, when they are being convicted and all that, they don't 
  understand the whole of this thing.  Most of the time you find that they always 
  leave out what they are supposed, in fact if you can go to all of them, one 
  has left something like explosives, the other has not applied for another thing, 
  because the problem is that it is read to them, it is Greek to them what is 
  being talked about in court, all this being separated, all these crimes, and 
  now it creates problems when he is not assisted.
CHAIRPERSON:   It would seem on their own version, 
  that they wouldn't have applied for amnesty for attempted robbery because they 
  say they never had any intention.  It is not for us to - is it - let me ask, 
  put it this way, is it for us to now rectify a conviction that shouldn't have 
  been made on their version?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   I am coming up to that point, 
  others have put armed robbery.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.
MR MBANDAZAYO:   If I remember very well, my 
  first amnesty application Judge Khampepe maybe will remember in East London, 
  we had a similar case of Madenazapo, a guy who was convicted of kidnapping.  
  It so happened that he did not know that he was convicted of kidnapping and 
  I still remember Judge Wilson said so, it was far fetched because it was all 
  in the process of committing the same crime, because they took away the people 
  who were there and at the end of the day, they were blowing, if I still remember, 
  they were blowing a petrol station in Uitenhage and they took away people at 
  gunpoint and they were saving them from being blown up.    At the end of the 
  day they were convicted, and they did not apply and the Committee found that 
  it was part and parcel of the whole process, that was a whole incident.  It 
  is therefore still my argument, and he was granted amnesty, despite not having 
  applied for that, because it felt that it was part and parcel and it is still 
  my contention even today, that in as much as they don't believe that they were, 
  but still it was part and parcel of the whole incident.  That is what I wanted 
  to touch on Chairperson and Honourable members of the Committee, thank you.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Did you not in this case fail, 
  therefore, Mr Mbandazayo to bring this particular aspect to the attention of 
  the Committee before you commenced leading evidence in respect of in particular 
  Mr Thobejane, because what is confusing is that in as much as Mr Thobejane has 
  not specifically mentioned this offence even though they all did not believe 
  that they should have been convicted in respect of this offence, because it 
  was not their stated objective as they believed at the time, the other applicants 
  have indicated that they wanted amnesty in respect of the offence of attempted 
  robbery.  I think Mr Mukhawana and the other applicant have done so, knowing 
  that this is something that as a result of the incident, that in any event has 
  been dealt with in their amnesty application, and it would not be like allowing 
  you to apply for an act that you had not originally applied for, within the 
  period that you are allowed to, why was it not brought to our attention?  Shouldn't 
  we blame you more than blaming the applicant?
MR MBANDAZAYO:   Chairperson, I want to concede 
  on that Chairperson, I want to concede definitely Chairperson, I did not pick 
  it up in fact Chairperson, I did not realise that it was not amongst the - when 
  I looked at the application, I looked, I think I looked at the others, so I 
  thought that also it is covered on that, that one I concede Chairperson, that 
  I also failed to pick it up Chairperson.  I only picked it up, in fact I wanted 
  to object to my learned friend when I realised that, I thought that he studied 
  the application, now I realise that he is the only one who does not have it 
  in the application Chairperson.  That I concede Chairperson, I thought that 
  because I saw it in the others, then it was automatically also present in his 
  application, I concede that Chairperson, yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  We will reserve our 
  decision in this matter and hope that it would be handed down in the very near 
  future.  That brings our role to an end, we will now be adjourning.  I would 
  just like to thank everybody who made it possible for this hearing to take place 
  here today.  We have been here before and enjoyed our stay.  I would like to 
  thank Mr Van Rensberg and Mr Mbandazayo and Ms Mtanga for their assistance in 
  the matter and the Interpreters for the work that they have done, the Sound 
  Technicians, the security provided for us, very efficient and the catering, 
  the Logistics Officer, I would also like to thank very much as well, and the 
  television crew.  Thank you very much indeed and we will now adjourn and that 
  decision will be handed down within the very near future.
