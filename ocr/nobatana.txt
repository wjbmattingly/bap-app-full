day, can you tell us how did you cope with the death of this young boy?

MS NOBATANA: The person who is at home right now is me and my late son,
and his sister but the sister is now staying at Kwanubushle. I am now
staying alone in the house. I am not satisfied, I am still dissatisfied
up till this day because if my child was still alive I would be staying
with him.

CHAIRPERSON: How far did he go at school, what standard was he doing?

MS NOBATANA: He was doing Std.4.

CHAIRPERSON: Did you go to the Jubilee Hotel?

MS NOBATANA: Yes, I've been to Jubilee Hotel.

CHAIRPERSON: In your statement you mention your dissatisfaction?

MS NOBATANA: Yes, I told them I was not satisfied, concerning the money
that they gave me because my child was going to support me financially.
My son was going to bury me and this R15 000 is not enough, is not
equivalent to that what he would do if he was still alive.

CHAIRPERSON: Can you tell us about your request?

MS NOBATANA: I ask that at least they must add something. I feel that
they must add something.

pension?

MS NOBATANA: Yes, I am getting a pension.

CHAIRPERSON: Is that all that you would like to say today?

MS NOBATANA: That is all, but I am not well. When I went to the doctor
the doctor asked me what was wrong and I told the doctor and the doctor
said I am suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor is Mr Castle.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much.
