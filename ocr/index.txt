 NB: Witnesses at TRC hearings were able to give testimony
      in their home language. Translators and transcribers worked in most of South Africa's 11
      official languages plus Polish. As a result, spelling errors (particularly of names)
      occur. There may also be incorrect transcription or translation in places. There are also
      many instances where a response was inaudible and  gaps appear in the
      transcription. Differences in text formatting mean some of the documents contain
      embedded footers, headers and incorrect page numbers. Transcripts are arranged chronologically.
