DAY 3

__________________________________________________________

CCHAIRPERSON: We are going to ask Mr Vincent Lungile Calu

to come forward. We are going to hand you over to Ms Maya

who is going to lead you with questions.

VINCENT LUNGILE CALU: (sworn states)

MS MAYA: Thank you Mr Chairperson. Lungile, how are you?

MR CALU: I am fine, thank you.

MS MAYA: You are going to represent yourself and tell us a

story about the time you were a member of the UDF and you

say you were arrested several times and tortured in police

custody, what was actually happening, and what was the

reason for all of this?

MR CALU: In 1985, I don't know whether to say that I was

lucky or unlucky, but I got affected and I became one of the

members of the structures for the youth. I therefore had to

go away from my home in Uitenhage, to I had to go in hiding

in one of the houses in Nobuhle. I used to spend nights in

various places and briefly, I would say that in 1986, one

day, I was tired of sleeping all over the place, and I

decided to go and sleep at home and it was on a Saturday and

yet, I was wrong because these policemen came and it was in

the morning, very early, at about 3:00, and I heard my

mother saying Lungile is not here because she knew that I

was not sleeping there and she wasn't aware that I was

there, so these police came and my mother said that I wasn't

there and there was three of us sons there. When they came

in, they asked for Umhlahla, then I said, no, I don't know

such a person. Then they asked my brother, where is

Umhlahla, my brother denied, and my other brother too

denied.

MS MAYA: Who was Umhlahla?

MR CALU: Umhlahla is me, I am Umhlahla. Then, these whites

asked who exactly amongst you is Umhlahla, and everyone

denied, infact, I wanted any one person who was going to

point at me, and these policemen were almost tired of asking

of this Umhlahla and I heard them saying in Afrikaans that

they should go and call someone from outside, and so this

person came.

	My brothers at the time, lived in Molapo, and this

Molapo men came in and said to me, you are Umhlahla, and I

was discouraged and then I didn't say anything, then these

policemen said get dressed.

MR MAYA: Were you arrested?

MR CALU: Yes, I was arrested. Outside our house, there

were a lot of cars and I got into a car, and there was a

driver sitting in front and a space here in the middle, then

I was asked to sit there in that space. Then they asked

about the gun that they said that I had, then I said that I

did not have a gun. They asked this repeatedly, then they

asked for Lungisile, then I said you arrested Lungisile last

week, so I don't know why you are asking me about Lungisile.

Then they asked me, do you know anything about Bee's? Then

I knew about Bee's, but I didn't want to say that I knew

them, because I was scared that perhaps they meant something

else. I didn't answer them.

	Then, they handcuffed me with my hands at the back, and

UITENHAGE HEARING	TRC/EASTERN CAPE

	3	V CALU

I was sitting in this space, in this car and they asked

whether I was going to tell the truth or did I want them to

bring in the bee's. Then I said that I don't have any other

truth, I do not have any gun.

	Then one other man who was there, there were some some

people, one of them was Dumse and these people were

informers and they were there. So they blindfolded me with

a towel and they made it stiff so that I was not able to

breathe. My whole body trembled and I thought perhaps that

these were the bee's that they had mentioned earlier and

some other times they would make this knot loose and they

would ask me to tell the truth, but I insisted that there

was no other truth that I could tell. Then they took this

thing, and they put it here in my testicles and I had a

feeling as if my testicles were being twisted and being

pulled because I kept on saying I don't know, I don't know,

very fast.

MS MAYA: As your body was trembling, what were they doing?

MR CALU: They were administering some electric shocks.

MS MAYA: Who was administering this electric shock?

MR CALU: I couldn't see because they had blindfolded me

with a towel, but I could feel me whole body trembling.

MS MAYA: How long did this take place?

MR CALU: For about 15 minutes, but they would give me a

relief and once again. Then in this car there was Ngobe,

there was Nokasi, there was Dumse. Then they asked why

Pinkise had been arrested, then they said that Pikinse was

brother to Nokasi and so ultimately Pikinse was released.

	Then one White man asked that I should be released and

then one said Ngashla was the commander of the action

committee that does this toy toy.

	They took off my hat and then one person was insisting

that I be released and they asked to release me and they

asked me to go away and I went home and found my mother.

MS MAYA: Then, when was the next arrest?

MR CALU: I want to say what I want to say before that. It

was early on a Sunday. I then consulted Dr Moodley, using

someones medical aid card because I was on the run. Dr

Moodley examined me and asked what had happened to me. Then

I told him that the police had electrocuted me and he

explained to me several things saying that these people had

exceeded in their administering of the electric shock and so

Dr Moodley asked me to take out two of my teeth that had

been damaged, so I had them extracted on Monday. So I again

went into hiding and the police still kept on looking for

me.

	Then in 1987, we had escaped once more and I was in

Port Elizabeth living in Betram Street. Then my aunt who

came from Zwide, and she told me that she was sick and had

they had not gone to work and she was saying that she must

consult a doctor. This whole day, the policemen had been

moving up and down here in Betram Street, but, I had a hope

that they did not know me, but I was wrong. Then there was

a car facing our house. It was parked in Matitiba, facing

our house. My aunt asked that I should not accompany her

because there were policemen, but I refused. Then, as soon

as I got to Betrom, I saw some cars that were speeding

towards me and the policemen jumped out and they were facing

there fire arms towards me. They searched my whole body,

they searched me thoroughly, they took a walkie talkie and

they asked what was me name, and I told them my name was

Mongezi, and I could see that they were communicating.

MS MAYA: Did you know these people who had arrested you?

MR CALU: No, I did not know them.

	They took me to the house where I came from and they

again searched the house. They did not tell me what they

were looking for. Then, this Black man said to me, these

men are looking for a firearm.

MS MAYA: Did they get the firearm?

MR CALU: No, they did not get any firearm from me. They

took me to Louis Le Grange.

MS MAYA: What did they do to you there, did they

interrogate you there?

MR CALU: No, they said, yes, this is the one. This is the

one we are looking for.

MS MAYA: Who said that?

MR CALU: Jagter said this. That is a Uitenhage detective

who is now a Captain in Le Grange.

	So, I spent the night there. The following morning, I

was called at about 6 o'clock in the morning and I went up

to the seventh floor where they were seated in a round table

and they asked whether I had a firearm, they asked this

question repeatedly and I told them that I did not have one.

Then, they took out a parcel and which had some soil inside

and they asked me, do you know anything about this? I

looked at it, and I could see that it was mine, and then I

was scared.

MS MAYA: Did you know this parcel that was shown to you?

MR CALU: Yes, I knew that it was mine, but to them, I

denied that it belonged to me. I then identified this

parcel. Then, they opened this parcel. It had some bullets

for a 9mm fire arm, there were 45 of these bullets. Then

they opened another plastic, there was a magazine with 15

UITENHAGE HEARING	TRC/EASTERN CAPE

	6	V CALU

bullets and a magazine and they asked, where is the main

part of this cassette, then I said to them, I know nothing

about this thing. They asked about the bullets of the 9mm,

I said I knew nothing about it. Then they said Lulamile,

your sister said that these belonged to you, and I denied

it. They kept on interrogating me, trying to get the truth

and then one Coloured person, who's name was Campbell,

because I could understand them as they were speaking

Afrikaans, that I heard that his name was Campbell, then he

again asked me, do you know anything about the bee's, and

then I said that I know the bee's. But I said to him that I

know nothing about bee's.

	Then he made me sit down, I want to demonstrate how he

made me sit down. This is how I sat, and there was a stick

just layed here on my hands. I had to hold the stick. They

call this action of sitting the helicopter, so they would

cover me with plastic and tie it very tight, so as to

suffocate me. They again used the thing a doctor uses when

he is trying to determine your blood pressure and they

tightened it and I was hanging in one of the tables, and

they would do this for five minutes, then relax and then go

back once more and all this time, they were asking me who

things these were.

	So, they ultimately said that these things belonged to

me, then they asked with whom was I staying, then I said I

was staying with Aubrey and Tini, because if they wanted to

go there, they were not going to find them. Then they kept

on torturing me for about 10 days, following the same

procedures as that on the third day. I appeared in court

and there was an allegation that I owned all these things,

that was in May.

UITENHAGE HEARING	TRC/EASTERN CAPE

	7	V CALU

	Then, from the court, I was locked in, in Algoa Park

and I was there for three days, and then transferred to La

Grange. For this whole month, people at home did not know

anything about my whereabouts. Then, on the 5th, I saw

someone in court and sent a message to my family that I was

in Le Grange. And then Vanessa came on the 5th, saying that

it is long that they had been looking for me. Then, Vanessa

said she was late and promised to come back the following

day and she came and already was from upstairs and Vanessa

said, you are being charged in this way, and she told me

what I was being accused of, And I had to appear therefore

on the 24 June, and my advocate was Mr Pillay, and Mr Pillay

got information from Campbell that a certain Mr X had

informed them with information.

	The following day, they took my sister and made her to

agree that I was responsible for all this and they belonged

to me and this case was postponed and anyway, I was found

not guilty.

MS MAYA: Now, did you ultimately admit, do you ultimately

know who brought this parcel to the police?

MR CALU: Even now, I am still wondering about who brought

this, because when we were hiding these things, there were

three of us, it was me, Abrey and Kiki. So I was worried

when this parcel landed in the wrong hands, landed in the

hands of the people who were not there.

MS MAYA: Where are they now? Did you ask them about this

parcel?

MR CALU: What about it?

MS MAYA: That who actually took it to the police.

MR CALU: People say, I noticed this. Jagter said that all

comrades are working for us and he said to me, in 1986, I

UITENHAGE HEARING	TRC/EASTERN CAPE

	8	V CALU

once planned to get to Durban, and I denied because I had

not gone there. We had planned to go there, but our plans

got aborted. So, I did not follow the comrades, but I was

very happy that this person was found and I was not the

informer. All I knew was that this Mr X was one of my

friends.

MS MAYA: Then, how has this torture affected your health?

MR CALU: When the police tortured me, they affected my

health. Some other times I feel that my body becomes

painful even if it is in the morning. They did not only

electrocute me, but the kicked me as well, but what mostly

effected me was the electric shock that I was subjected to

and it caused a lot of damage.

MS MAYA: What is your request to this Commission?

MR CALU: I didn't mention, here when they were writing this

statement, that I would like this Commission to take note of

this, that this was not done to me because I was Ngahle, but

they were trying to damage the idea that we as Black could

think we could liberate this country. So all this happened

under the conditions of discouraging the various structures

and they various organisations that were fighting for

freedom of this country, all this was not directed to me but

it just happened that I got affected. It was politically

motivated.

	Then, I am asking this Commission, I know that there

isn't much that it can do, but I recognise it as it was

appointed by the government, perhaps it has the power that

we as all the victims here in South Africa, could especially

those who got disabled during this struggle, because looking

at the other countries, I find that incidents of this

nature, were happening, but their governments did attend to

UITENHAGE HEARING	TRC/EASTERN CAPE

	9	V CALU

their victims, and those people got some compensation

because these people did give their lives in this battle for

the people. If perhaps I had not joined the struggle,

perhaps my mother would still be alive, she died because I

was arrested, repeatedly, and this greatly affected her

life.

MS MAYA: Could I ask you that you should allow me to help

you so that we could conclude. Your request is that there

should be projects for job creations, those are the people

who could not further their education because of the

tortures of that time, and even those who are still at

school should be assisted to go back to school and even

those who are disabled, should be assisted through, because

they definitely had some goals. So if they were to be

assisted to achieve their ambitions, you would feel very

comfortable?

MR CALU: Yes, I did say so. Thank you.

MS MAYA: Thank you.
