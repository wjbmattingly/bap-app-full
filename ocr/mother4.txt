Is that correct?MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.MR CORNELIUS:  Would you be able to identify that area again?MR VERMEULEN:   No.MR CORNELIUS:  Why not?MR VERMEULEN:   Because I am not familiar with Port Elizabeth and it would be difficult for me to point that area out again.MR CORNELIUS:  Yes, and it has also appeared from evidence before the Commission that you were in fact misled in that all kinds of circuitous routes were taken with you to mislead you.MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.MR CORNELIUS:  And that is also the reason why you gave weak testimony in the court, you were in fact misled.MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.MR CORNELIUS:  When you arrived in the area, as appears from previous applications, there was a white Jetta car which had been prepared.MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.MR CORNELIUS:  What had been done to this car?MR VERMEULEN:   Explosives had been placed in the boot and also in the passenger cabin.MR CORNELIUS:  What type of explosives?MR VERMEULEN:   Use was made of commercial explosive and also military type of explosive.MR CORNELIUS:  And the detonator mechanism, what was that?MR VERMEULEN:   The detonator was a radio-controlled detonator.MR CORNELIUS:  Did you assist in the placing of the explosives?MR VERMEULEN:   No.MR CORNELIUS:  Were you present, should you be needed?MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.MR CORNELIUS:  Who actually placed the explosives in the car?MR VERMEULEN:   It was Mr Waal du Toit and Mr Kobus Kock.MR CORNELIUS:  After the vehicle had been prepared, what happened then?MR VERMEULEN:   We then moved back to Port Elizabeth.MR CORNELIUS:  That evening, along with Snyman and Ras you returned to the so-called Motherwell crossing, is that correct?MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.MR CORNELIUS:  After that, where did you go?MR VERMEULEN:   From the crossing, Motherwell crossing, we went to the place where the Vlakplaas vehicle had been secreted and I stayed behind there.MR CORNELIUS:  Why did you stand behind?MR VERMEULEN:   I stayed behind to look after the vehicles.MR CORNELIUS:  How far was this point from the Motherwell crossing where the bomb actually exploded?MR VERMEULEN:   About two to three kilometres.MR CORNELIUS:  Can you tell the Committee what happened later?MR VERMEULEN:   I waited at the vehicles and about 45 minutes later Mr Ras and Mr Snyman arrived there, and told me that the operation had been successful.

Mr Vermeulen, can you recall whether Mr Nieuwoudt was present at Vlakplaas when Mr De Kock gave you the order? MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.MR HUGO:   Can you tell us what the precise purport was of the motive explained to you by Mr De Kock, the motive for the operation?MR VERMEULEN:   That there were members in the PE security branch who had been causing problems and that an operation had to be carried out in Port Elizabeth.MR HUGO:   Did Mr De Kock at any stage indicate an Askari or Askaris?MR VERMEULEN:   As far as I can recall there were three people and an askari.MR HUGO:   Yes, but the question is; did Mr De Kock use the word Askari or Askaris when he told you about the problems these people were causing?MR VERMEULEN:   I can't answer that because I can't remember it well.  As far as I can recall, I am sure that the word Askari was used.MR HUGO:   And are you saying that Mr De Kock told you that these people were in the process of going over to the ANC or had already done so?MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.MR HUGO:   I have no further questions.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGOMR BOOYSENS:  No questions, Mr Chairman.NO QUESTIONS BY MR BOOYENSMR JANSEN:  No questions, Mr Chairman, on behalf of Snyman.NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSENCHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kemp?MR KEMP:  No questions, Mr Chairman.NO QUESTIONS BY MR KEMPMR JANSEN VAN RENSBURG:  Mr Chairman, maybe I should just come on record to say on behalf of applicant Ras there is also no questions.NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN VAN RENSBURGCHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I apologise, I overlooked you, I'm sorry. Yes, thank you.CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR FORD:  	Thank you, Mr Chairman, for and on behalf of Mrs Mgoduka and Mrs Faku.  Mr Vermeulen, do I understand your evidence to be that your colleagues during the preparation stages in Port Elizabeth, deliberately confused you or misled you with regard to the identities of those participating, was that the effect of your evidence? MR VERMEULEN:   No, the evidence is that they misled us by not finding the proper venue where the car was prepared.MR FORD:   I see.  So you were aware at all times of all of those involved in the preparation of the bomb in the motor vehicle, by whom the motor vehicle was brought, et cetera?MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.MR FORD:   Was Mr Lotz at any stage present?MR VERMEULEN:   I don't know, I have never seen him at the scene.MR FORD:   Now you have suggested in your evidence that if you did not carry out this order, there was a real chance of you losing your work and also that you could be eliminated?MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Mr Chairman.MR FORD:   What brought you to that conclusion, Mr Vermeulen?MR VERMEULEN:   At that stage I was involved in lots of operations before that, and I know about a lot of sensitive information.MR FORD:   Now you heard Mr De Kock's evidence of the relationship which he had with his men and which he stated quite clearly that what his attitude would have been if one of his men had felt unable to participate in a certain operation?MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.MR FORD:   If I understood his evidence it was that it may have led to - certainly not a question of elimination of that person, he may have been less readily promoted, but there is no question of him being eliminated, just because he didn't feel capable of participating in a special operation?MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, it is not necessarily that elimination would have come from Mr De Kock.  The senior people higher above could have decided something like that.MR FORD:   Did you ever have any reason to suspect that if you had declined to participate in this operation, Mr De Kock wouldn't just have appointed somebody else in your place?MR VERMEULEN:   He could have, Mr Chairman.MR FORD:   Were you - happy is not the appropriate word, but you were ready to participate at all times?  Did you have any hesitation about this operation?MR VERMEULEN:   No, I didn't have any hesitations.MR FORD:   Why not?MR VERMEULEN:   Because when I received orders from my seniors, I always tried to comply, Mr Chairman.MR FORD:   The point I am trying to make, Mr Vermeulen, is that you obeyed this order, not because you were afraid of being eliminated, but because that was the way you operated.MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.MR FORD:   And I am putting it to you then, Mr Vermeulen, that your suggestion that there was a real possibility of you being eliminated in these circumstances, is just not correct.MR VERMEULEN:   No, I won't say that.MR FORD:   Just give me a moment, Mr Chairman.  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORDCHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brink?MR BRINK:   I have no questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.NO QUESTIONS BY MR BRINKCHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination?RE-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:  Only one question, thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Vermeulen, you obeyed the order because you simply had no choice? MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Mr Chairman.MR CORNELIUS:  And depending on the breach of your security measures, that will depend what type of action will be taken against you?MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, Mr Chairman.MR CORNELIUS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUSCHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may step down, Mr Vermeulen. MR VERMEULEN:   Thank you.WITNESS EXCUSED    MR CORNELIUS	420	N J VERMEULEN PORT ELIZABETH HEARING	AMNESTY/EASTERN CAPEMR HUGO	430	N J VERMEULEN MR FORD	433	N J VERMEULEN MR CORNELIUS	434	N J VERMEULEN
