NELSON JINIKEKA: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: Is there something you would like to say otherwise you can
just confirm what has happened.

MR JINIKEKA: I would be redundant. There was no stone that was left
unturned. I just want to thank....

	I was wondering what I was going to say here because everything has been
said, even what I thought I would say.

	Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you Sir.

	I will remember what you said even when I am back home. I will use the
terms that you used today, when one is being redundant, I will remember
your terms exactly.
