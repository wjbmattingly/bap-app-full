NONI MABHALA GCABA: (sworn states)

MS MAYA: Good afternoon Mrs Gcaba.

MS GCABA: Good afternoon.

MS MAYA: You are going to talk about James Notununu who has passed away.
Is that so?

MS GCABA: Yes.

MS MAYA: How are you related?

MS GCABA: He is my father.

MS MAYA: You say that he was detained and tortured. Do you have any idea
how he was tortured?

MS GCABA: Yes, he came back and told us that they beat him up on his
genitals. They were tortured in all sorts of ways.

MS MAYA: Where was he detained?

MS GCABA: Where Mandela was detained.

MS MAYA: Was this in Robben Island?

MS GCABA: Yes.

MS MAYA: Until when was he detained?

MS GCABA: It was from 1960 to 1961. He was very ill. He was taken to
Clarewood and King Edward Hospitals in Durban. He came back eventually
and he passed away at home.

MS MAYA: What was he ill of?

MS GCABA: He said that he had been given poison to drink. It affected his
lungs. His one lung collapsed. The other lung collapsed too and that was
when he passed away.

	He came back in 1961. Then I think he passed away in 1963.

MS MAYA: According to your statement he and other detainees were given
poison to drink and they all passed away.

MS GCABA: Yes, a man from the Mangatywa family, Skunana, they all drank
poison and eventually passed away.

MS MAYA: Is there anything else that you would like to add?

MS GCABA: Well, my mother died. She had a heart failure and a stroke and
passed away. Because of the whole situation we were left as orphans.

MS MAYA: When did your mother die?

MS GCABA: In 1985.

MS MAYA: Do you have requests.

MS GCABA: My parents were buried in separate places Their request before
they passed away is that they be buried in the same place. It means that
my father would be exhumed and come and be buried next to my mother.

MS MAYA: Where is you father buried?

MS GCABA: In Jusana and my mother at my brother's place in Mcobothini.

MS MAYA: Thank you madam. Is that all?

MS GCABA: Yes thank you.
