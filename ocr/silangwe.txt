DAVID ZIFOKOFE SILANGWE: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: You have heard the evidence that was put before us. Do you
confirm this evidence?

	If you confirm the evidence, is there something that you would like to
add?

MR SILANGWE: I would like to repeat the request concerning Nonqulana.

	If one goes to our meetings nothing is said about Nonqulana, but now we
realise and we will remember that everything started on this mountain.

	We request that the Government does something about this mountain.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.
