They were shooting at you.  If I have it correctly, Mr Erwee shot 30 shots, Mr Kruger about 15, Mr Swarts about 15, you, 20 and with the pistol 9 or so shots.	Why couldn't it have happened that you for instance shot 10 shots and then said to the people, hands up and surrender?MR PRETORIUS:	According to my training, as soon as you open fire, you deliver maximum fire.  I am not prepared to go back and find out whether these people are still able to return fire, I wouldn't endanger my life like that.CHAIRMAN:	You can shout from the casspir?MR PRETORIUS:	I supposed we could have shouted from the casspir.ADV DE JAGER:	Would you say that was minimum force?MR PRETORIUS:	I am satisfied that we acted in accordance with my training and correctly.	Perhaps we could have shot even more, but we didn't.MS KHAMPEPE:	I think Mr Pretorius maybe in fairness to you is to restate that you had your ground Commander in the casspir and you shot in his presence and he didn't say anything to stop you? 	He only gave the instructions to cease your firing after some time.MR PRETORIUS:	That is correct Chairperson.CHAIRMAN:	Mr Visser?ADV VISSER:	I have no further questions to the witness, thank you Mr Chairman.NO RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER.CHAIRMAN:	Thank you Mr Pretorius.	--------------------
