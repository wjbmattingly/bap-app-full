NORMA KUBISHI MBWANA: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: You have heard Thlapo Silangwe giving evidence here
yesterday. Is there something that you would like to add?

MS MBWANA: No Sir. I am not going to add anything.

	I am very glad that Nonqulana was mentioned here today and it was
clarified that Nonqulana is a historical mountain, so that the next
generations know that this was the origin where people died for the land.

	If the Government can do something about Nonqulana we would be very
pleased.

	Thank you.
