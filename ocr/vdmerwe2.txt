Mr Visser?FURTHER EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr Van der Merwe, there is something which I forgot when you were testifying.   You told us that after the events there was a Press conference or a Press statement was released, regarding these events, and in this Press statement it was said that seven terrorists had entered the country in the mini-bus and that one of them or that six had been killed and that one had escaped.MR VAN DER MERWE:  That is so, Chairperson.ADV VISSER:  Could you say who was responsible for that Press statement?MR VAN DER MERWE:  I made the statement to the then SABC. ADV VISSER:  Yes, the facts are not entirely correct, because the seventh person who escaped was not a so-called terrorist but a policeman namely Matthews Sehlwana.MR VAN DER MERWE:  That is entirely true, it was done in order to conceal the true facts, namely that a policeman had been present.ADV VISSER:  And why would you have wanted to conceal that fact?MR VAN DER MERWE:  To protect Sehlwana and to conceal his involvement in the matter.ADV VISSER:  That is all the evidence in this regard.  It is fact that happened and I thought you should be aware of it.CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Mr Van der Merwe.   	-------------------------         ADV VISSER	61	W J VAN DER MERWE  PIETERSBURG HEARING	AMNESTY/NORTHERN PROVINCE
