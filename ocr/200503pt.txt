 TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
 AMNESTY HEARING
DATE:	3RD MAY 2000
NAME:	NICHOLAAS JOHANNES VERMEULEN
APPLICATION NO:   AM4358/96
MATTER:	ATTACK ON TRANSIT HOUSE IN BOTSWANA 		ON 11 DECEMBER 1988 - (PART-HEARD)
HELD AT:	METHODIST CHURCH, PRETORIA
DAY:		16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAIRPERSON:   Anybody care to tell us why we're starting late?  Anybody want to venture?  No.  It's probably an act of God, seeing that we're sitting in the church.
	Where are we now?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Mr Chairman, may I assist?
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   At the last stage when we adjourned this hearing, my client, Mr Hoffman, had finished his evidence and his re-examination and I think the Committee was in the process of asking one or two questions.  As you will notice in the transcript, pages 157, I think it finished at 1567.  The transcript, not the ...
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that number.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   The transcript indicates that at the stage when we adjourned, Mr Chairman, yourself and Judge Khampepe were asking certain questions in clearing up certain issues with my client and at that stage it transpired that there was a victim that wasn't notified, but everybody, all the attorneys present had already cross-examined Mr Hoffman.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I think I had exhausted my questioning.  
ADV BOSMAN:   I have no questions to put to Mr Hoffman, Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   I can't even remember if I had.  He's excused.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Thank you, Mr Chair.
WITNESS EXCUSED
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Mr Chairman, that concludes my clients for this hearing.
CHAIRPERSON:   Who's next?
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr Chair, Cornelius for the record.  I call N J Vermeulen.
NICHOLAAS JOHANNES VERMEULEN:   (sworn states)
CHAIRPERSON:   Please be seated.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I've been given to understand that I might be brief in this matter.
CHAIRPERSON:   Excuse me?
MR CORNELIUS:   He's one of the footsoldiers, so I'll be pretty brief in leading his evidence.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
CHAIRPERSON:   Normally they haven't got much to say.
EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:   Quite correct.
	You prepared your application according to Section 18 of the Act, and you gave your cooperation to the Investigative Team of the TRC, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   You were an employee of the South African Police, as defined in Section 29(2)(b) and (2)(f) of the Act, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is.
MR CORNELIUS:   You were seconded to the C-Section of which de Kock was in charge.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   You confirm your amnesty application as it appears in the bundle, concerning the general background and the political motives thereof.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   You followed the instructions of de Kock and worked on a need-to-know basis.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   And you acted at all times within the service of the police.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   You are an explosives expert, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   You manufactured an explosive device, which was used in this specific incident in Botswana, is that correct?  ...(transcriber's interpretation)
CHAIRPERSON:   Could I ask the following question?  I do not want to be funny, but we all know what happened in the country in the past, the knowledge that you had about explosives, was it to manufacture bombs, to identify bombs or to defuse bombs that were found?
MR VERMEULEN:   Chairperson, I was an Inspector of Explosives.
CHAIRPERSON:   What I would like to know is, what did your tasks entail, was it to manufacture bombs for the purpose, for example, in this case or was it for when they find bombs, to then inspect and identify them, or to say what they were?  And thirdly, that if they found something, for example, in a shop, that you would then diffuse this bomb?
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, the last two that you mentioned is correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   And the manufacturing of bombs was just a later aspect of your tasks, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   That is.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  You mention in your application that you carried a "platter", could you explain to the Committee what a "platter' is.
MR VERMEULEN:   Mr Chairperson, it consists of a plastic pipe, the cover which I can estimate would be about 20cm, the length would be approximately 30cm, and I would say at the front of this pipe it had a round piece of metal that fitted into the pipe and then at the back the pipe was full of explosives and then it was detonated mechanically or electrically from the back.
MR CORNELIUS:   Very well.  And this specific device, did it have an electrical detonator?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   And what was the length of the cord?
MR VERMEULEN:   The platter itself was taken to the target, it was mounted with a detonating device, in order to give it a safe distance and at the end of the detonator device we would then add a spring charge and then detonate it from there.
CHAIRPERSON:   What type of problems could this bomb cause?  If I could put it as such.
MR VERMEULEN:   It can result in major damage.  The platter or the metal in the front is quite heavy and it will then forced out at a high speed.
CHAIRPERSON:   You describe the bomb that was used to damage or destroy this house
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   You saw this house?
MR VERMEULEN:   The night that we went there, yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   It could have been described to you before you made this bomb.
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   How did you then know how big this bomb had to be then to create the necessary damage?
MR VERMEULEN:   Quite a while before that -  we were not specifically tasked to partake in this operation, at the last moment I was involved, or I became involved.  I experimented with the explosive devices, because you can use different devices for example, for a car bomb.
CHAIRPERSON:   So you prepared this beforehand and you could then just take what you needed for an operation.
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   So you did not manufacture a bomb specifically for an operation.
MR VERMEULEN:   No, this bomb was not made specifically for that operation.
CHAIRPERSON:   How can I say, did you place it in a cupboard and then use it when necessary?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   Just to clarify it for the Committee, I understand in consultation you said that you tested this bomb at the mines.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   And that you then found that it was sufficient.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   Can you just explain to the Committee in short.  You went to the scene, what happened then?
MR VERMEULEN:   We crossed the border in the evening.  It was quite a distance from the building.  We came together there.  I think Mr Ras carried the bomb up to the house.  We took out the cortex.  There was a problem with the electrical wiring, it was in a crow's nest and we could not place it at a safe distance.  The bomb was then quickly detonated.
MR CORNELIUS:   You are now talking in general, can you give more specifics.  Did you try to lay the wire down and then it became entangled.
CHAIRPERSON:   And you knew what the operation was about, you received your instructions "bring a bomb along, we are going to do something"?  ...(transcriber's interpretation)
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you arrived there you realised what you had to do.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   And you agreed with it.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   You knew that this bomb could kill somebody.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, I did.
MR CORNELIUS:   And you also knew that this was a transit house and it was for purposes of the ANC, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   When you couldn't get the wiring set out, what did you do then?
MR VERMEULEN:   I took the open ends of the wiring, I connected the battery and an explosion occurred.
MR CORNELIUS:   You were quite close to it and you were then covered with dust and gravel.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   What happened then?  We understood from the evidence that the walls of the house collapsed.  ...(transcriber's interpretation)
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   And after the bomb was detonated, what did you do then?
MR VERMEULEN:   We then moved back to the house, I moved around the house.  I did not see anyone.  I heard shots being fired ...(intervention)
MR CORNELIUS:   Can I just assist you.  You submitted evidence to the Committee, that behind the ANC facility there was a round rondawel with a thatched roof, was that the lapa that you are referring to in your application?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   You set it alight.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   Did it have walls?  Did it have reeds or clay?
MR VERMEULEN:   As far as I know it had a very low wall around it, but it was not up to the ceiling.
MR CORNELIUS:   It was mentioned that it could have been a cooking place.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, I assumed it was a cooking facility.
MR CORNELIUS:   Did you see anybody in this rondawel?
MR VERMEULEN:   No.
MR CORNELIUS:   How did you set the thatched roof alight?
MR VERMEULEN:   There was a candle there, I kept it up to the ceiling and it caught alight.
MR CORNELIUS:   Did you then take part in the shooting afterwards?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   You did not ...(intervention)
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   May I interpose, Mr Vermeulen.
	Why was it necessary for you to set this lapa on fire, you've just testified that there was no-one inside this lapa.
MR VERMEULEN:   The only reason why I did it was because it was the ANC transit facility and I decided that while we're destroying it, I can destroy the rest of the buildings as well.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Was it part of the instruction that you had received from Mr de Kock, that you should destroy any property?
MR VERMEULEN:   Nobody gave me an instruction to destroy the rondawel, I did it on my own.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Was it not against the instruction that you, the general instruction that you had been given?
MR VERMEULEN:   Not as far as I am concerned, no.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Why not, because your instructions were to destroy the main building with a detonator?
MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And your instruction was not to destroy any property using ...(indistinct)
MR VERMEULEN:   Well I felt - as I said, I took it on my own to destroy the rondawel, because it was used as a transit facility to make food, so that's why I destroyed it.  I didn't get any instruction to do it, I did it on my own.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   What about the other building that was  left standing?  That was not destroyed.
MR VERMEULEN:   I don't know, I didn't even - to tell you the truth, I didn't even know there was another building, Mr Chairman.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Thank you.  Mr Cornelius.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Judge.
	There were no disciplinary actions taken against you because of the fact that you destroyed this rondawel, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   You believed that you acted in accordance with the  country's interest, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.
MR CORNELIUS:   And to prevent any further infiltration of ANC members.
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   After you detonated the bomb, did you then leave the scene and go back to South Africa?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is correct.
MR CORNELIUS:   Except for the salary that you received, did you receive any other bonuses or any incentives to do this work?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   You did not get any personal gain?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   You had no personal feelings of hate against the victims?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   Did you make a full disclosure of all the facts, according to your knowledge?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   And you then ask for amnesty on two incidents of murder and all offences under the Act on Explosives, and whatever may result out of it, is that correct?
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr Chair.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS
CHAIRPERSON:   The blowing up of the house, would that not be arson?
MR CORNELIUS:   It will be arson as well.  I've actually included it in the malicious damage to property, but arson would be quite correct, to include arson.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
MR NEL:   I've got no questions for Mr Vermeulen.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL
MR JANSEN:   No questions, Chair.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Van der Merwe on record, Mr Chairman.  No questions, thank you.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR VAN DER MERWE
MR LAMEY:   No questions.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO(?):   Thank you, Mr Chairman, just two aspects.
	Mr Vermeulen, evidence was given that after this operation occurred, you received merit certificates, did you receive such a certificate?
MR VERMEULEN:   I cannot remember, Mr Chairperson, certificates were handed out but it was given out within a wide spectrum.  I cannot remember if it was for that specific operation.
MR HUGO:   Those were the certificates that were signed by Gen van der Merwe, and were handed out to the members.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, it could have been.  I did receive some of them, but I cannot remember if it was concerning this specific incident.
MR HUGO:   And then just the last aspect.  Evidence was given that this operation was mainly handed over to Mr Ras, that he did the planning, the preparation etcetera, and that Mr de Kock came in at a later stage, on an operational level.  Is that also how you experienced it?
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is correct.
MR HUGO:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Maribana.
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MARIBANA:   Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  J C Maribana on behalf of the victims.
	Mr Vermeulen, I've got just a few questions for you.  Firstly, I just want to find out how far the charge was put from structure Y.
MR VERMEULEN:   Mr Chairman, that I won't be able to answer because I didn't place the charge itself, I was just the person that ignited the electric detonator.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Mr Vermeulen, you are free to respond in your language.  You can use Afrikaans in your response.
MR VERMEULEN:   Thank you, Mr Chair.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay, the other aspect I would like clarity from you on, I just want to find out from you Mr Vermeulen, would you be able maybe to tell this Committee as to - if you can remember, when you detonated the charge, did someone order you to do that or you just did it on your own?
MR VERMEULEN:   At that stage somebody would have said to me that the detonator is set, because I wouldn't have been able to detonate it with the electric wiring if somebody was close to the main detonating device, I had to get the instructions to go ahead.
CHAIRPERSON:   Or some kind of sign?
MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, yes.
MR MARIBANA:   And the other thing - okay, as you have just indicated that you remember setting the rondawel alight, will you be able maybe to remember as to how did it come that structure X, that is the family house, how did it catch alight?
MR VERMEULEN:   Mr Chairperson, I cannot say.  When I set he rondawel alight I just saw that the flame started  burning properly in the rondawel itself and that then we withdrew from the scene.  I was about 500m away and when I looked back I saw the roof of the rondawel itself burning.  I did not see that the big family house was burning at that stage.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay Mr Vermeulen, there's evidence before this Committee, I can't remember exactly whether it was from Mr Ras or from Mr Hoffman, that at a certain stage when you looked back you could see that the family house was on fire.  Do you remember maybe seeing the family house on fire on that day in question?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson, all that I can remember is that I saw the rondawel alight.
MR MARIBANA:   And now just one question more.  About the structure Y, when you detonated the bomb, did that charge destroy this structure completely, or how was it destroyed actually by that bomb?
MR VERMEULEN:   As far as I can recall, the wall - I would say it was number E, that wall was completely destroyed, the roof or the ceiling fell in at that side.  I did not enter the house itself, so I cannot say what it looked like inside, but I know that the wall E was completely destroyed and the ceiling was, or the roof was completely collapsed in.
MR MARIBANA:   And what about the other part of the structure where it was written ANC and then it was B1 next to it?  Did it fall or what happened actually?
MR VERMEULEN:   That I don't know, Mr Chair.  It was dark and I didn't check there.  As I said, the only thing that I know for sure was that the roof and the wall marked E, that was completely destroyed.
MR MARIBANA:   And did you - as you about that other structure where it was written B, when you got near the structure, or you'd been proceeding towards the rondawel, was that structure still intact?
MR VERMEULEN:   I don't know, Mr Chair, I can't say because I didn't look at that structure.
MR MARIBANA:   Mr Vermeulen, I've got instructions that even structure B was completely destroyed on the day in question, what is your comment on that?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Structure B?
MR MARIBANA:   I mean this one - excuse me, Madam Chair, structure Y.  On that other part the witness has just indicated that he can't remember ...
MR VERMEULEN:   I won't deny that, but as far as my memory can allow me I can say the first structure, that is number 2, that was destroyed, the rest I don't know, I didn't look, I didn't enter that building at all.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   By that you mean you don't know whether structure X was destroyed or not?
MR CORNELIUS:   Judge, sorry to interrupt.  He's referring to structure B, that is the ANC facility.  Judge, do you have a copy?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I don't have a copy, but I do recall the structure.  It's just that it's a little bit confusing because we've got two structures, structure X and structure Y, but he's referring to the side on structure X.
MR CORNELIUS:   He's referring to these two over here.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes.
MR MARIBANA:   Madam Chair, if I can just put the Chairman in a better light.  Mr Vermeulen has just indicated that on structure Y, what he can remember is that that part which is marked E, it was completely destroyed.  I just wanted to find out from him about this other part, not about structure X.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes, it was a little bit confusing because he referred to that side as a structure and not the wall or the side in structure Y.
MR MARIBANA:   Thank you, Madam Chair.
	And then lastly, did that charger maybe have an effect on structure X?
MR VERMEULEN:   Just repeat that question.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay.  The detonating of the charger, did it have any effect on structure X?
MR VERMEULEN:   I won't be able to comment on that because I didn't see that building, Mr Chair.
MR MARIBANA:   And I've got instructions that the walls of that structure, for structure X, were destroyed as well.  What is your comment on that?
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that possible?
MR VERMEULEN:   Not from the detonation or the detonating of that explosive, it would not have been able to destroy X.
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you wouldn't have said that it was because of the explosion.  Do you have knowledge, of the fact that maybe that building was damaged?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, I did not even see that building.
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  So you cannot say?
MR VERMEULEN:   No.
MR MARIBANA:   If I may just ask you, do you remember any weapon, except the charger, which could be able to destroy the wall of that other building?
MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chair.
MR MARIBANA:   As it pleases.  I've got no further questions.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MARIBANA
MS PATEL:   Thank you, Honourable Chair, I have no questions for the witness.
NO QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL
MR CORNELIUS:	 I've no re-examination, thank you Mr Chair.
NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I have not questions for Mr Vermeulen.
ADV BOSMAN:   I have no questions, Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you're excused.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr Chair.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Vermeulen, you can be seated.  You said that you were applying for two murders, offences pertaining to the Explosives Act, as well as arson.
MR VERMEULEN:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In that building which was blown up, I understand from previous evidence that there were two persons who were at least injured, and it appeared that they were dead at that time.  What about them?
MR CORNELIUS:   If I may interrupt.  That will obviously include two attempted murder charges then as well.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I just want to ask all the legal representatives to, even now, consider what they're going to ask amnesty for at the end of the day, just to list it even if your client has already testified.  I just want clarity on that before we finish with this matter.
MR CORNELIUS:   As the Chair pleases.
WITNESS EXCUSED
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, the next applicant is Nortje.  I just beg leave to call him.
NAME:	WILLEM ALBERTUS NORTJE
APPLICATION NO:   AM3764/96
--------------------------------------------------------------------------ON RESUMPTION
WILLEM ALBERTUS NORTJE:   (sworn states)
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated.
MR LAMEY:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Just before I start, on behalf of the applicant we just want to apologise that he's not dressed in a suit and tie, we anticipated that the examination of further applicants would happen today, and I just wish to be the Chairperson's pardon in this regard.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that all of us were somewhat confused. 
MR LAMEY:   As it pleases you.  Chairperson, before I lead further evidence, there was a request for further particulars from the Amnesty Committee, addressed to the applicant, which was answered.  I don't know whether you have a copy of that.  I would just also ask the applicant to confirm that.  It's not in the bundle ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page would that be?
MR LAMEY:   It's not in the paginated bundle, but I do recall that copies, I think, were distributed.  I'm not sure whether the Evidence Leader has given copies to everybody.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you can hand it in for what it's worth.
EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:   As it pleases you, Chairperson.  I'll just hand it in at the end of his evidence then - or at the start then.  As it pleases you, Chairperson.
	Mr Nortje, is it correct that initially you prepared an amnesty application in your own handwriting, which can be found on page 19 to page 21 of the bundle which has been placed before this Committee?
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   And attached to that was an annexure which was typed, in which you incorporated with your amnesty application, a typed affidavit which you had made before the Goldstone Commission in Denmark, previously.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   On page 27 and 28 of the bundle there is also the typed version of the particulars which you provided pertaining to this attack on the transit facility at Ramatlabana, is that correct?
MR NORTJE:   Yes.
MR LAMEY:   And then, after you submitted your initial application you obtained legal representation and a supplementary application was prepared, which we can find from page 29 to page 34, incorporating an annexure which commences from page 35 of the bundle, is that correct?
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   From page 35, up to and including page 43, there is a survey of your background, your training and how you ultimately became a member of the Security Police, and more particular Vlakplaas, under the command of Col Eugene de Kock, is that correct?
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   At the stage of this incident - before I get to that, on page 44, up to and including 46, we then find also supplementary particulars pertaining to your participation in this operation, is that correct?
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   And at the time of this incident you were a member of Vlakplaas, under the command of Col de Kock.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Can you recall your rank at that stage?  That was towards the end of 1988.
MR NORTJE:   I was a Sergeant. 
MR LAMEY:   Very well.  From your application it appears that there was reasonable confusion in your mind with regard to the correctness of the date, you initially referred to 1989 and then in a supplementary affidavit, it was 1990, and you also referred to Mr Nick van Rensburg who was the overall Commander at that stage.  You have heard the evidence of the other applicants, indicating that this incident took place in December 1988.  What I want to ask you is whether or not you are prepared to accept this date as correct?
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   In your further particulars you stated in paragraph 1.2, that you were not specifically certain of the date, but if this was during 1988, which you are prepared to concede to, you would accept that Brig Schoon would have been the overall Commander of C1 or Vlakplaas, and that the reference to Brig van Rensburg would then be incorrect.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Brig van Rensburg however did assume command of Vlakplaas in 1989, if I am correct with regard to previous amnesty applications.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Mr Nortje, how long before the application did you receive the order to become involved in this operation?
MR NORTJE:   I was involved with the logistical arrangements and I assume that it was approximately a week before we departed.  That is when I made the necessary arrangements with Logistics.
MR LAMEY:   Were you aware at that stage that prior reconnaissance work had been conducted, as it has been testified to here by Martiens Ras, who was a Warrant Officer at that stage under the command of Mr de Kock?
MR NORTJE:   I had information, but I didn't have details regarding what precisely was going to happen.
MR LAMEY:   However, when you became involved in this operation you were aware that this would involve a bomb attack on a transit facility.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Then I would like to ask you, subject to the evidence that you have given verbally, whether or not you confirm the particulars which have been provided in the supplementary application and also in your initial application on pages 27 and 28, as well as 44 to 46.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, that is correct.
MR LAMEY:   There is just one aspect that I wish to clarify with you - you have brought this aspect to my attention - on page 28 you say that you had observed the house for a full week by means of an observer or a source, who stated that there were MK operatives living in the house.  Is the use of the word "source" correct?
MR NORTJE:   No, I've realised that it isn't entirely correct, but at the time of the complication of my application I wasn't entirely certain of all the facts and their relevant order, but as I have explained here, I would accept that this is what took place.  That was just my attempt to explain it.
MR LAMEY:   Mr Ras testified that at one stage he attempted to recruit a person as a source, but the information pertained to the situation at - or the location of the place.  The movements of the persons residing at this place were obtained by means of your monitoring, what exactly did you do with this operation, Mr Nortje?
MR NORTJE:   I crossed the border that night.  I was a member of the support team.  We came to a point near the house and placed the bomb.  I recall that I saw when the person emerged from the structure, and this is when the crisis ensued. 
MR LAMEY:   Where were you?
MR NORTJE:   I was some distance away.
MR LAMEY:   And what was your participation in this operation?
MR NORTJE:   Basically I did nothing.  After the explosion I went in and I turned the head of the one person who lay there dead, and we took a photo.  I think Mr Ras took the photo, but I held the man's head and then the photograph was taken, and subsequently I went out with the group.
MR LAMEY:   So the only thing that you did during this operation was to turn the head of a person you assumed to be dead, for the purposes of a photograph?
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Why did you accompany the group on this operation?
MR NORTJE:   As a support member, in the event of something going wrong.
MR LAMEY:   May I just ask you whether or not a weapon was issued to you as a contingency measure in the event of problems arising?
MR NORTJE:   Yes, I was armed.
MR LAMEY:   What would you have done if the operation had not gone entirely according to plan?
MR NORTJE:   In the heat of the moment I would have decided what to do.
MR LAMEY:   But provision was made.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, provision was made in the event of a shooting.
CHAIRPERSON:   When you went to the house, did you know that persons would possibly be murdered?
MR NORTJE:   The plan was for the bomb to explode, but as I have explained, things went wrong and then this had certain consequences.
CHAIRPERSON:   Listen to my question.  Under way to the house, what did you think was going to happen once the bomb had been placed?  People would definitely have died?
MR NORTJE:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you agree with this?
MR NORTJE:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   And you were also prepared to shoot people dead in the event of something going wrong, in the event of them shooting at you.
MR NORTJE:   Yes, certainly.
CHAIRPERSON:   And your task there was to provide support in the event of defence being required.
MR NORTJE:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   But you also understood or knew that there was a definite possibility that the result of the journey would be the eventual death of people, because that was the purpose behind your journey.
MR NORTJE:   That would have been the purpose for the four persons residing in the house.
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that later, after the incident, you held someone's head up so that photographs could be taken, did you do anything else?
MR NORTJE:   No.
CHAIRPERSON:   But you agreed with everything that was done there.
MR NORTJE:   Correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   Any further questions, Mr Lamey?
MR LAMEY:   Just one final question.
	The person with regard to the photograph, could you just indicate on Exhibit A1, do you recall in which room of the facility this took place?  The facility which was damaged by the bomb.
MR NORTJE:   I think it was towards the left side of A.  The middle room collapsed and the person lay there.  That is how I recall it.  That is when we took the photograph.
MR LAMEY:   You also state in your application, and I think that Mr de Kock also referred to this, according to the observation and your knowledge thereof, the expectation of your group and the operation was that on the evening of your attack four MK members would in that specific building which you would be attacking.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   And then, did you observe something else after the explosion, with regard to structure A?  Any other persons, did you find any other persons there?
MR NORTJE:   I recall that I saw another person laying below the rubble and dust and I assumed that there had to be another person, because we knew of the one who had gotten away, but I didn't see the third one specifically, I just saw the one of whom we took the photograph and then there was another who lay below the rubble and we assumed this person to be dead.
MR LAMEY:   Just for clarity, you saw the one person of whom you took a photograph, who was clearly dead, and then you saw someone else under the rubble.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   And then you also assumed that there had to be a third person somewhere in the demolished building and then a fourth person who had managed to escape.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   In conclusion, with regard to the political objective and the command and approval, before the operation was launched, did it come to your knowledge that this entire operation enjoyed the approval of the Security Police Command?
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   And do you then also confirm the political objective, command and approval as set out on page 46?
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, may we then deal with the specific offences in argument?  The applicant has stated in his application:  Conspiracy to murder;  attempted murder and any other offence which may not be specified.
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you not in a position to list this for us right away?
MR LAMEY:   I can do so.
CHAIRPERSON:   Please go ahead.
MR LAMEY:   Mr Nortje, I will do so by means of a leading question.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you may go ahead.
MR LAMEY:   Very well.  On behalf of the applicant we then request amnesty for conspiracy to murder;  murder ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   How many murders?
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, the applicant was under the impression that the person who he saw below the rubble was also dead.
CHAIRPERSON:   How many people died there?
MR LAMEY:   It would appear to be common cause, according to the evidence, that two persons were dead.  On the basis that it is common cause, we then request amnesty for the murder of two persons.  With regard to the other persons it would boil down to attempted murder, for which amnesty is also requested, and then conspiracy to murder with regard to any other persons who were the target of the attack.  And then also, intentional damage to property.
CHAIRPERSON:   For what?
MR LAMEY:   Regarding the structure Y, I would ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a fixed structure?
MR LAMEY:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Then that should include arson.
MR LAMEY:   Yes, Chairperson, I ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot have damage to property when it comes to a house, unless you smash in the windows, but if there was a fire to a fixed structure, then it is arson.  As far as I know.
MR LAMEY:   I do not wish to argue with you, but I recall that with regard to a fixed structure, one can be found guilty of damage to property and arson would pertain to the causing of a fire to a structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this things was blown up.
MR LAMEY:    Chairperson, then I would incorporate arson with that, but just to be on the safe side, damage to property and then ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Of what?
MR LAMEY:   Property damage of the building as a structure with regard to Y, which is indicated on the sketch plan.
CHAIRPERSON:   But how would that be damage to property?
MR LAMEY:   By means of the explosion.
CHAIRPERSON:   But that's the point.  It wasn't chopped down or sawed down.
MR LAMEY:   As it pleases you, Chairperson.  I will then leave it to your discretion.
	Then with regard to the firearm, I understand that some of the members have requested amnesty for the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, but according to the applicant he was legally issued with the weapon.
CHAIRPERSON:   But it cannot be legal if it was used for illegal purposes.
MR LAMEY:   But the weapon in his possession was a legal weapon, but the application thereof was illegal.  However, it was not a weapon which was smuggled in or unlicensed or illegal, it was legally issued to him by the police.
CHAIRPERSON:   But the use of the weapon was illegal.
MR LAMEY:   Yes, I would say unlawful use of a firearm.
CHAIRPERSON:   But then that would mean unlawful possession, because he had it in his possession for the wrong reasons.  It was issued for those purposes, as I understand it.
MR LAMEY:   Yes, as it pleases you.  For those purposes I will then also list unlawful possession of a firearm in transgression of the Weapons and Ammunition Act.  	Then with regard to his complicity regarding the mutual objective with the bomb explosion, it would then also include any offence of the Explosive's Act ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to ask you with regard to the bomb, could there be a mutual objective with regard to the possession of a bomb or the explosion of a bomb?  I know the facts with regard to firearms, isn't there something similar?
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, I could refer you to the Cosatu House and Khotso House findings of the Amnesty Committee, and the applicant here was also an applicant in those matters, particularly with the Cosatu House explosion.  He has received amnesty.  And similarly he was a member of the support group, he did not place the bomb as such.
CHAIRPERSON:   What concerns me is that according to his evidence he never had that bomb in his hands.
MR LAMEY:   No, Chairperson, but I think if one examines the situation prior to the incident, the applicant went with the group to place the bomb and whoever carried the bomb is immaterial.
CHAIRPERSON:   But the possession of the bomb is something extreme, such as the possession of a firearm.  Mr A cannot be found guilty of the unlawful possession of a firearm if he never carried the item in his hands.  It is an element of that offence.  I am not really certain of a bomb, that is why I'm asking whether or not the same is of application to a bomb.  To me it would appear to be so, but I could be incorrect.
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, I would say that the applicant knew as a member of Vlakplaas, that this was an illegally manufactured bomb and that this was in transgression of the Explosives Act, that this was going to be applied for an unlawful objective, and although he did not carry the bomb physically, his task was to give execution to the usage of that explosive device, and also, to act in a supporting capacity in order to ensure that the bomb would be used.
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand you, I will follow that line.
MR LAMEY:   As it pleases you.  Chairperson, I think that covers everything.  Then there is:  any further offence which may be incorporated on the list of offences according to the amnesty decision, or any other delict or omission which may emanate from the facts.  And then I've almost omitted to state this, in addition to the items on this list there would:  any delict or omission or offence which may emanate from the illegal crossing of a border.  That is all.
MR NEL:   Thank you, Mr Chairman, Nel on record.  I've got no questions for the applicant.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Thank you, Mr Chairman, van der Merwe on record.  I have not questions for the applicant.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Just one aspect.
	Mr Nortje, the plan was simply to plant this bomb, to damage this building or to destroy this building and then to withdraw.
MR NORTJE:   That is correct.
MR HUGO:   And then something went wrong.
MR NORTJE:   Yes.
MR HUGO:   Did you know, or were you aware of the fact that the plan to use explosives was according to the Defence Force, that asked for it?
MR NORTJE:   That is correct, yes.

CHAIRPERSON:   You haven't got any questions?
MS PATEL:   No, I don't, thank you.

MS PATEL:   That's what I said, Honourable Chairperson.
MR LAMEY:   As it pleases you, Chairperson.  Then that doesn't make it necessary to hand up as an additional exhibit what I have in front of me.  Thank you.

MR HANTON:   No, at the base where we worked from at the dam where we were camped.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  How would you contribute to this operation?

MR HANTON:   That would be my contribution, Mr Chairperson.
MR NEL:   Thank you, Mr Chairperson.
	Do you confirm the correctness of the application and also the political motive set out in your application found in the bundle?
MR HANTON:   I do, Mr Chairperson.
MR NEL:   And as I was saying, you ask for amnesty for conspiring to murder;  two counts of murder;  two counts of attempted murder, and also arson.
MR HANTON:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.

	Mr Hanton, on page 59 of your application, the top paragraph which starts with "After", on the last sentence you've said:



		"From what I've understood from what they said, the operation was only partially successful."



Will you be able maybe just to explain, what do you mean "from what they said, the operation was partially successful"?
MR HANTON:   By that I mean, Mr Chairperson, that it didn't go according to the original planning, that things went wrong.
MR MARIBANA:   What went wrong actually?
MR HANTON:   The fact that instead of just having the explosion, other things happened.
MR MARIBANA:   Other things like what, Mr Hanton?
MR HANTON:   Mr Chairperson, as explained by the other applicants, the shooting of people at the target.

WITNESS EXCUSED
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that all the applicants?  Anybody going to call any witnesses in support of the applicants' cases?  Mr Maribana, what do you propose to do?
MR MARIBANA:   Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, at this stage, on behalf of the victims I've got instructions from two of the victims, Mr Chairperson, that they would like to give testimony before this Honourable Committee.  Just ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, call them.
MR MARIBANA:   Firstly, I will call Funi Steven Lesole.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Won't you just spell that for us, Mr Maribana.  The surname as well as the name.
MR MARIBANA:   Funi: F-u-n-i, Steven: S-t-e-v-e-n, and Lesole: L-e-s-o-l-e.
CHAIRPERSON:   L-a?
MR MARIBANA:   L-e, Mr Chairperson, Lesole.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Lesole.
MR MARIBANA:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Excuse, Mr Chairperson, before we proceed we need earpieces if he's going to give evidence in his native language.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Lesole, which language would you prefer to use?
MR LESOLE:   I'll speak Setswana.
CHAIRPERSON:   Very well.
FUNI STEVEN LESOLE:   (sworn states)
CHAIRPERSON:   Please be seated.
EXAMINATION BY MR MARIBANA:   As it pleases, Mr Chairman.
	Mr Lesole, it is correct that in 1988 you were a member of ANC.
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
MR MARIBANA:   And it is correct that on the 11th day of December 1988, you were in Botswana at Ramatlabana.
MR LESOLE:   It was on the 10th of December.  I was at Diratapeng.
MR MARIBANA:   Mr Lesole, let us say in December, or more particular, at the time of the attack, were you at that place that you have just mentioned, Diratapeng, in Botswana?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
MR MARIBANA:   And there is an incident which took place, whereby you were attacked by the Security officers, do you still remember that?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, I do.
MR MARIBANA:   And it is correct that you were one of the people who were in structure Y on that day, or in the evening of the attack.
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
MR MARIBANA:   And during consultation you indicated that you would like to put some of the things before this Honourable Committee, which you feel that they might be important to help the Committee when it makes a finding, is that so?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
MR MARIBANA:   And just to confirm that it is correct that you don't dispute or put in dispute the fact that the said where you were on the day in question, was used as a transit house.
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
MR MARIBANA:   And there are a few things in order for us to put this thing clearly.  I want us to tackle these things in category - I mean in categorical order.  Firstly we'll start with the herd boys.  Do you still remember the names of the herd boys in this particular incident?
MR LESOLE:   I knew only one boy and the other one who came to visit this young boy.
MR MARIBANA:   And then what is the name of the boy who came to visit at that place?
MR LESOLE:   His name was Rapula.
MR MARIBANA:   And this Rapula, how can you tell this Honourable Committee about his role in politics?
MR LESOLE:   On our side as members of the ANC, he did not give any assistance to us, so we just saw him as a visitor at that house.
MR MARIBANA:   So if one understands you correctly, that he wasn't involved in politics?
MR LESOLE:   He was never involved in politics.
MR MARIBANA:   And is this boy, Rapula, the one who was killed in the attack?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, he was killed.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay.  Now let us go back to the herd boy you said you know, what is his name?
MR LESOLE:   His name was Kuntakana(?).
MR MARIBANA:   And then, what was his role at that time?  As far as politics are concerned.
MR LESOLE:   We used him to send him to go and have a look for us at what was happening near the borders.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay.  And then there was this woman who was seen at the transit house, what is her name?
MR LESOLE:   Her name was Matiko Anna Lesole.
MR MARIBANA:   What was her role as far as politics were concerned at that stage?
CHAIRPERSON:   Was she family to you?
MR LESOLE:   She was my mother.
MR MARIBANA:   And then my questions was, what role did she play at that particular time?
MR LESOLE:   Her duty was to welcome the people and assist the people who were coming from Zimbabwe, into South Africa.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay.  Now let us go to the events which took place in the evening on Sunday.  How many ...(intervention)
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   May I interpose, Mr Maribana.  By reference to people, are you referring to ANC activists?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, that's correct, I'm referring to the people who were coming from the training from other countries and coming into South Africa.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Thank you, Mr Maribana.
MR MARIBANA:   Thank you, Madam Chairperson.
	So I was just saying you know, let us go to the events which took place, Sunday in the evening.  How many MK members or ANC people were in structure Y?
MR LESOLE:   We were three in that structure.
MR MARIBANA:   And do you still remember their names
and if so, may you be able to give their names to this Honourable Committee?
MR LESOLE:   It was Moshengu, Sidwell and myself, apart from Kuntakana.
CHAIRPERSON:   You, Moshengu and ...?
MR LESOLE:   And Sidwell.
MR MARIBANA:   And during our consultation when I explained to you the evidence before this Honourable Committee, that there was evidence which says one person went out to urinate, do you still remember who was that person?
MR LESOLE:   It was myself.
MR MARIBANA:   And may you be able maybe in your own words to tell this Honourable Committee that from the time when you went out, what did you observe and what have you done?
MR LESOLE:   When I went outside to urinate I saw white people outside, amongst them one of them said "there he is, let's get him."  He was saying that in Afrikaans.  The other one patted me on my shoulder.  I shouted and I was informing the people who were in the house, I was making them aware.  I was not dressed at that time.  Then after he has patted me on my shoulder, I ran into the house.  
	I had an AK47 in my room and I went to fetch that AK47, and I peeped through the widow at the side facing the dam.  I realised that they were lighting torches and then I shot towards that light and I told Kuntakana to ran with me.  We ran outside together with Kuntakana and we fled.
	After that, I realised that the people who were in the main house, that is my mother and my father, were standing at the door.  I shouted at them, I told them that we are being attacked by the whites, and they also started shooting with bazookas.  That is white people.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And where were you when they started shooting with bazookas?  Were you outside the two-roomed structure which has been referred to as Y?
MR LESOLE:   I was outside, just next to the main house.  	I also started shooting at them, but I only had one magazine with me at that time because my other bags were in the other room where Moshengu and others were sleeping.  So I didn't have time to run into that room.  As I was shooting at them - I continued shooting at them, enabling the people who were in the main house to run away.  But these people were shooting with other guns, very powerful guns that I didn't know which types of guns they were, but they were very powerful.
	Then I realised that Rapula was scared and he ran towards the house again.  When he ran back to the house, they continued shooting at him ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   To which house?
MR LESOLE:   He was running from the family house and he ran back to the family house again.
	After I finished my magazines they were continuing shooting, but at that time they had not yet demolished the house and the other group entered the house and the other group was also attacking the other part of the house. 	Then from the main house I could hear Rapula shouting.  I heard two shots from the main house.
...(intervention)
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Did you hear what he was saying as he was shouting?
MR LESOLE:   He was just screaming.  He wasn't saying anything, he was just screaming.  And the other one entered the house in which I was sleeping and he continued shooting there.  He shot three times in that house.
...(intervention)
MR MARIBANA:   And at that stage, how far were you from the premises, structure X and Y?
MR LESOLE:   I was next to the place that we used for cooking.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay, you may proceed.  And then?
MR LESOLE:   And then I saw the main house burning, the thatched house burning.  When I realised that I ran back.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Was the main house made of thatch?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And was there also a rondawel just behind the main house?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, there was also a rondawel which we used as a kitchen.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   When you first saw the main house burning, what was the state of the rondawel?  Was it also burning at the about the same time?
MR LESOLE:   No, it was not yet burning.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Thank you.
MR LESOLE:   And after that I heard the bomb from the house in which we were sleeping.  After that ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait now before you carry on.  You ran back to the main house, then what happened?
MR LESOLE:   No, I did not run back to the main house, I was just next to the two structures and I was watching as all these things were happening.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   During this period of the shooting, where was Moshengu and Sidwell?  Did you have an opportunity to observe whether they actually ran out of the Y structure?
MR LESOLE:   They did not manage to escape, because I only heard them cocking their firearms but I didn't see them going outside and I only saw the white people running into that house where they were sleeping.
MR MARIBANA:   Okay you heard the bomb and then the structure in which you were sleeping was destroyed.  Do you still remember as to what happened to the people, more in particular Sidwell and Moshengu who were still there?
MR LESOLE:   In that room where I was sleeping I only heard three bullets, so I don't know what happened to Sidwell and Moshengu.  After the white people had left, I went back and that's when I realised what had happened to them.
	When I came back I saw Sidwell, he was still inside the house next to the door.  And then I went back to the house that caught fire, and in that house I could see a person, but he was already burnt.  I could see that it was a person who was lying there, and the other girl who was present showed me Moshengu.  I removed all the bricks which were on top of Moshengu and I realised that he was still alive at that time.  From there I went to get the donkey cart so that we could run away, because I was afraid of the Botswana soldiers.
CHAIRPERSON:   What happened to Moshengu, you took him with?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, I did take him with me.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Have you been able to establish the identity of the person who was burnt beyond recognition inside the main house?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, I later learnt that it was Rapula, and I knew that he ran into that house.  He used to sleep with the parents in that house.
MR MARIBANA:   Thank you, Mr Chairperson, that is all from the witness, Mr Lesole.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MARIBANA
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got any questions?
MR NEL:   I've got no questions for the victims.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr van der Merwe, have you got any questions?
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN DER MERWE:   Yes, Mr Chairperson, just one or two.
	Mr Lesole, your mother and father, as the people who this property belonged to - I take it this was their house.  Am I correct in saying that?
MR LESOLE:   It belonged to a person who was working there.  That is my father.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Was your mother and father active supporters of the ANC at that stage?
MR LESOLE:   My parents were supporters of the ANC.  My mother came to work with that man there and my mother used to stay with my father in Mafikeng and then she went to Botswana to stay with a certain man there and work with him.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Did they move there with the express intention of assisting in the struggle at that stage?  Is the reason why she moved there to assist in the struggle?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, Chairperson, they moved with the intention to help the ANC with its struggle, until the whole family moved out there after this operation, then they went back to Mafikeng.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   The herd boy, Kuntakana, was he family of yours of how did he fit in, where did he come from?
MR LESOLE:   He was not a family, but he was a son to a man who was working there.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   So was he a South African citizen or a Botswana citizen?
MR LESOLE:   He was a Botswana citizen.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Your mother and father obviously realised that taking part in the struggle in the way that they assisted the struggle at that stage, that their lives were in danger and at risk, cooperating like this and making this transit facility available to the ANC and their cadres at that their stage.  Am I correct?
MR LESOLE:   I would not know and again, I would not speak on their behalf, but I believed they knew because when they participated in the struggle they knew that they were enemies to the white people.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Well let me put it this way.  You expected attacks on that facility earlier already, am I correct to say that?
MR LESOLE:   No, Chairperson, I did not have any expectation for an attack because we did not hope to be attacked in Botswana, but we knew that we would be attacked in South Africa.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   The premises - whenever there were cadres from Umkhonto on these premises, there would be firearms and weapons, am I correct to say that?  So the people were always armed when they came through there, or most of the time.
MR LESOLE:   They did not come armed, but I would be the one who would be armed, then I would hand over the arms to them when they arrive.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   So you were the source of supplying them with weapons and arms as they entered South Africa, am I correct to say that?
MR LESOLE:   No, Chairperson, I would not give them to enter South Africa, they would only use those arms to guard the house and when they infiltrate South Africa I would not give them those arms.  Those arms were only used to protect the premises.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   So you had arms specifically assigned to yourself to protect the premises and just the transit facility.  They would be given the instructions(sic) inside South Africa, so they infiltrated South Africa without arms?
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr van der Merwe, where are we going with this?  They went back to Botswana.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   No, we're not going back to Botswana.  If you look at the application or when it started, there were various attacks or - initially on transit houses.  This is not what's worrying me, but at the moment to make it clear to the Committee that everybody who was present at in this house was part of -or the people who participated in the operation were part of the government and you cannot say then that some are innocent and others are more innocent.  If a Defence Force attacks another country's Defence Force, you do not draw a circle around the chefs and say, we are not going to attack the chefs and only attack the soldiers.  That is the point that I would like to make.  But I will it there, I won't take it any further.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Mr van der Merwe, I personally wouldn't like to be seen to be curtailing your cross-examine, if what you are saying is intended to assist us, I would have thought that you would have limited your cross-examination on Rapula, because I don't think any other person who actually fell under the attack of the applicants, was any person other than an ANC supporter, member or activist.  I think it's quite clear, that is not in dispute.  I mean, from the evidence of Mr Lesole himself.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Thank you, Madam Chair, I am moving in that direction.
	Mr Lesole just to assist in, specifically the application of Mr Hoffman in this matter, these premises I take it at night, was it well lit, was it dark, what was the situation regarding light?
MR LESOLE:   Do you mean in the house or just around the premises?  Inside the house or just in the premises?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Let's say both, describe both to us.  Tell us how much light there was inside the house and outside the house.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let's put it this way ...(intervention)
MR LESOLE:   There were no lights in the premises because it was in a rural area, so at night it would dark.  So there would be no lights outside the houses.
CHAIRPERSON:   Rapula you say was a friend of the herdsman.
MR LESOLE:   Yes, he was a friend to Kuntakana.
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he come there often?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, I used to see him at that place, though he would not come on a daily basis.
CHAIRPERSON:   Age-wise, was he in the same age range more-or-less, as the herdsman?
MR LESOLE:   I am not able to testify on the age groupings.
CHAIRPERSON:   ...(indistinct) similar?  More-or-less.
MR LESOLE:   Yes, that is correct, Chairperson, on my observation they would be on the same age.
ADV BOSMAN:   More-or-less how old were they?
MR LESOLE:   I would estimate their age, 14 to 15 years old.
ADV BOSMAN:   Thank you.
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you know whether Rapula knew that Kuntakana went to have a look out for you at the border?
MR LESOLE:   I don't think he knew, because I instructed Kuntakana that it should be a secret.
CHAIRPERSON:   And what time of day did this incident occur?
MR LESOLE:   I don't understand, Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   What time of day or night did this attack occur?
MR LESOLE:   It would be around ten past twelve.
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I don't know if I heard you correctly, did you testify that Rapula slept at that homestead sometimes?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, he used to sleep there sometimes because he used to visit there.  He used to stay at Klapeng, which is quite a distance from the place of the incident.
CHAIRPERSON:   Would he sleep at the main house or at the house that you occupied?
MR LESOLE:   They used to sleep at the main house.  At that particular day I requested Kuntakana to sleep at that house because there were some people.  So he went to sleep at Kuntakana's(sic) room.
CHAIRPERSON:   I see.  Would you say that Rapula, in the circumstances that prevailed there that night without lights, could have been mistaken for Kuntakana?
MR LESOLE:   I'm not sure, Chairperson, it could have happened because they were of the same age.
CHAIRPERSON:   Similar builds?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, they were similar in height and it was dark, that you would be able to make a mistake.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And usually Mr Kuntakana used to sleep in the main house.
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, Chairperson, Kuntakana used to sleep at the main house.
CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any other questions, Mr van der Merwe?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   No, thank you Mr Chairman.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN DER MERWE
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen, have you got any questions?
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR JANSEN:   A few, thank you Chair.
	Mr Lesole, what is your present age?
MR LESOLE:   I'm 35 years old, Chairperson.
MR JANSEN:   Can you remember when you joined the ANC?
MR LESOLE:   I started working with the ANC from 1984, then I went for training in 1986.  In '84 I was working with the ANC, without training, helping my mother to help the ANC members, and then I was supposed to go for training in 1986, then I trained in 1986.
MR JANSEN:   Am I correct, I'm not exactly sure of your birthday, but in 1984 you would have been round about 18 or 19 years old?
MR LESOLE:   I don't remember how old I was at that time.
MR JANSEN:   What year were you born?
MR LESOLE:   I was born in 1965.
MR JANSEN:   In 1984 were you helping your mother with the infiltration of ANC members into South Africa?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, Chairperson, I was helping the ANC members to infiltrate the members of the ANC, because there were those who were not able to communicate in Setswana, therefore I would help to infiltrate them during the night with routes I identified to go through Mafikeng.
MR JANSEN:   Now you mentioned another man who was living in the main house, can you remember what his name was?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, that is Mr Tabane(sic)
MR JANSEN:   Just to avoid any confusion, he was not your father, was he?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, Chairperson.
MR JANSEN:   Do you know a first name, can you remember what his first name was?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, that is correct, I knew his first name.
MR JANSEN:   What was that?
MR LESOLE:   That Tawana Molema.  Molema is the surname, Tawana is the name, the first name.
MR JANSEN:   Was that his ordinary residence, or did he also have another place where he was ordinarily resident?
MR LESOLE:   That was his house, and again he had another house in Mafikeng.
MR JANSEN:   Did his wife live in Mafikeng, in the house in Mafikeng?
MR LESOLE:   His wife has since died, because when I started working with them I found him not having a wife.
MR JANSEN:   But who was living in the house, was other family of his living in the house in Mafikeng?
MR LESOLE:   It was myself and Mr Tawana and Kuntakana and Kuntekana's brother who were staying in that house.  But I knew that he had three children and they were staying in the house in Mafikeng, they were not staying in Botswana.  In Botswana he was staying with Kuntakana only.
MR JANSEN:   Do you recall, or were you at any stage informed that Kuntakana had been arrested or had been interrogated by members of the South African Security Forces?
MR LESOLE:   I remember, Chairperson, because after he was detained he later informed me that he was arrested and then he was beaten by white people and he was told to work with them.
MR JANSEN:   Yes.  Now you surely, at that stage, must have realised that there is a very good chance that the South African Security Forces were observing that house ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen, does it really matter whether this witness realised that or not?  In terms of the Act.
MR JANSEN:   Well, Mr Chair ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Let's assume that the worse scenario for your case is that he didn't know, as he's testified, that he was in danger, does it really matter?
MR JANSEN:   Mr Chairman, I will obviously argue that it does not, so I'm afraid that there might be - I would like to also argue a further point, is that from an objective point of view, there was a danger that was known to the inhabitants of that house and ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Well does it matter that they knew or not?
MR JANSEN:   Well I think it assists my - I don't think it matters at the end of the day, Mr Chairman, but I think it does assist my case if they did know.
CHAIRPERSON:   I think my colleague, Ms Khampepe, made it quite clear to Mr van der Merwe what the position was.
MR JANSEN:   ...(indistinct), Chair ...(indistinct - no microphone).  Sorry, Chair, if it's not of crucial importance, I will not proceed with that ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   I don't want to sound like I'm stopping you, but ...(intervention)
MR JANSEN:   No, I accept that.
CHAIRPERSON:   ... it's rather - one doesn't know where this is going to, given the evidence before us already and what has been conceded.  In fact, all this has been conceded in your case.
MR JANSEN:   Yes.  No, I accept that, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, that is my last question, I don't think it's inadmissible, so maybe if he can just answer it because I have no further questions.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN
CHAIRPERSON:   I hope that's not your case that fell there.  Have you got any questions, Sir?
MR CORNELIUS:   I have no questions, thank you, Mr Chair.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Lamey?
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:   Just one or two questions, Mr Chairperson.
	Mr Lesole, the arms and - the AK47s, the arms that you kept at the premises, and I think you also mentioned handgrenades, is that correct, that you kept there for protecting the transit facility - did I understand your evidence correctly?
MR LESOLE:   That is correct, Chairperson.
MR LAMEY:   Now where were these arms and handgrenades kept in that facility?
MR LESOLE:   I kept them at the house where I would put these people to sleep in.  I would inform them that they should have those arms to protect themselves whilst they were still in the transit house.
MR LAMEY:   But in what did you keep it?  Was it ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Lamey, he says at the house, does it matter whether it was in a cupboard or under a bed or wherever?
MR LAMEY:   Alright.  You mean - I don't know whether you've seen the sketch plan here, do you mean the structure Y, not the main house?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I think his evidence-in-chief was that it was kept in structure one, and to be precise, in the room that was used on that night, by Sidwell and Moshengu.
MR LAMEY:   And the arms and handgrenades were continuously kept in that structure, is that correct?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, we'd have them there all the time.  I would only remove them there when I go to Lebatse or in another place, but if there are people in that house, I would just leave them there for them to use them to protect themselves and the structures.
MR LAMEY:   Now what prevented a visitor to those premises, like Rapula, who often visited the premises, to enter structure Y?
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Mr Lamey, what is the purpose of this line of cross-examination?  We have already I think, suggested what is of trouble to the Panel, and that is the justification for the killing of Rapula, and not the manner in which Rapula was killed.  And that's the only issue which I think can be traversed by the legal representatives acting on behalf of the applicants.  Otherwise I don't think there is anything which is in dispute, because the evidence from the victims is supporting the applicants' case.
MR LAMEY:   No, I fully appreciate that and I do - I also just wanted to try and establish also perhaps knowledge which Rapula himself had about what was going on at that transit facility.  But if it doesn't take it any ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Lamey, perhaps, I think in - and I don't want to sound subjective, I think you'd do your case a disservice and a disfavour if you traversed that line, because you may just get the wrong answers.  It's dangerous territory you're traversing.  You've heard what my colleagues have to say.  But I leave it in your hands.
MR LAMEY:   Well as it pleases you, Chairperson, I won't take the matter further.  Thank you.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hugo?
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:   Thank you, Mr Chairman, just two aspects.
	Mr Lesole, you testified that you're a trained MK soldier, and I take it that when you referred to a bazooka, can you just give us some explanation of what your understanding is of a bazooka.  Let me rather try and shorten the situation.  There was a dispute about an RPG7 that was taken ostensibly to go and plant it at the scene of the accident, is your understanding that the bazooka and the RP7, that they're the same thing?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, they are the same, Chairperson.
MR HUGO:   And your recollection is that there was a bazooka or an RPG7 that was used during this incident.
MR LESOLE:   It was the bazooka which was lying on the ground.
MR HUGO:   Ja, but you testified that they started shooting with the bazooka, so your recollection is that they actually used it to shoot during the incident?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, they used only bazookas during the incident, then they used other kinds of firearms when they entered the structures.
MR HUGO:   And then just one last aspect, which is really more an interesting point.  The death certificate in respect of Mr Rapula, makes mention of the fact that he died due to asphyxiation or suffocation, did you notice any bullet wounds on him afterwards?
CHAIRPERSON:   The body was burnt, isn't it?
MR LESOLE:   How would I see the bullet wounds whilst he was burnt.  I would not be able to see bullet wounds on the chest, body.
MR HUGO:   Very well, no further questions, Mr Chairman.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO
CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination ...
MS PATEL:   Honourable Chairperson ...
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I'm sorry, I keep on forgetting you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:   That's fine.
	There's just one curious aspect that I think baffles me in this case, Mr Lesole, do you have any idea how the main house caught alight?  Did you happen to see how that happened?
MR LESOLE:   The way these people used the bombs, I think the fire was started by the bombs.  I'm not sure what kind of bombs were used.
MR HUGO:   Ja, absolutely, alright.  Thank you, Honourable Chairperson, I have no further questions.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL
CHAIRPERSON:   Any further questions, Mr Maribana?
MR MARIBANA:   No further questions, Mr Chairman.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I have no questions for Mr Lesole.
ADV BOSMAN:   I have no questions, thank you Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to know the full names of all the victims please.  You are Funi Steven Lesole.
MR LESOLE:   That is correct.
CHAIRPERSON:   Where can we contact you?  Have you got an address?
MR LESOLE:   Yes, I do have an address.
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you give it to me please.
MR LESOLE:   Zone 2, T60, Galeshewe, Kimberley.
CHAIRPERSON:   Spell it.
MR LESOLE:   Galeshewe:  G-a-l-e-s-h-e-w-e.
CHAIRPERSON:   Any other victims?  Your mother.
MR LESOLE:   My mother is staying Mafikeng, in Motlapeng Section.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what's her full names?
MR LESOLE:   Matiko Anna Lesole.
CHAIRPERSON:   What's her address?
MR LESOLE:   She's staying in Motlapeng village.  I don't have her full address.
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you willing to accept a postal address at your address on her behalf?  I understand that we do have her address.  What is it?
MS PATEL:   Honourable Chairperson, I'll just check the record, we've got full details of all the victims, I can supply it to you later if you so wish.
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Then you are excused.
MR JANSEN:   Mr Chairman, if I may interrupt, sorry.  There was mentioned by this witness of a girl that was also on the scene, I'd forgotten to ask the name of that girl, because it may be relevant for the portion of our seeking amnesty in respect of the attempted murder charges.
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the name of the girl that was there that you referred to?
MR LESOLE:   Keitumetse Moroke.
CHAIRPERSON:   Spell it please.
MR LESOLE:   K-e-i-t-u-m-e-t-s-e, that is Keitumetse - Moroke: M-o-r-o-k-e.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you, you're excused.
MR LESOLE:   Thank you, Chairperson.
WITNESS EXCUSED
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Maribana, have you got any more witnesses who may add to what this witness - I'm hoping though that you call nobody that's just going to repeat what he said.
MR MARIBANA:   Mr Chairperson, I've got one witness, Moshengu.  It is my instructions that he just wants to clear the air, because it was published in the media that died on the day of the incident.
CHAIRPERSON:   He wants to prove that he's alive.
MR MARIBANA:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   And assuage the guilt of the applicants.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, show the applicants they did such a bad job.  What is his name?
MR MARIBANA:   Steven Bahumi, and then is nickname, or MK name is Moshengu.  Bahumi: B-a-h-u-m-i.
CHAIRPERSON:   Bahumi?
MR MARIBANA:   Bahumi.  That is correct, Mr Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Bahumi, what language would you prefer to use?
MR BAHUMI:   English.
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you any objection to the taking of the oath?
STEVEN BAHUMI:   (sworn states)
CHAIRPERSON:   Please be seated.  What do you want to tell us?
MR BAHUMI:   The only thing which I want to tell the Committee, is that it is true we were - I was part and parcel of that incident, of the raid which took place in 1988.  It is true it was a transit house which we were using.  When we were coming from other countries we were passing through in infiltrating the country, yes.  But the only thing like my attorney said, that I only wanted to clarify the Panel, that they must be knowing that on that day, like the applicants are claiming that I've died on that scene, because I've heard that on the media.  I only wanted to be informing the Panel that no, I'm still alive, there's nothing like I have died.
CHAIRPERSON:   I think they all understand that now.  Tell me, you were injured that day?  Were you injured?
MR BAHUMI:   Ja, it was braises and those rebels - my ribs were - but I went for an X-Ray in Zimbabwe.
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it okay?
MR BAHUMI:   Ja.
CHAIRPERSON:   What are you doing now?
MR BAHUMI:   I'm in National Intelligence Agency.
CHAIRPERSON:   Here in Pretoria?
MR BAHUMI:   No, in Free State Province.
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that all you wanted to tell us?
MR BAHUMI:   Ja, I only wanted to clarify that.
CHAIRPERSON:   I hope everybody accepts that the man is alive now.  Is there any cross-examination?  Are there any questions?
MR NEL:   No questions, Mr Chairman.
NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL
MR VAN DER MERWE:   No questions, Mr Chairman, except to say that I think there's still people that think it might be his twin brother.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen?
MR JANSEN:   No questions, thank you Chair.
MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Chair, no questions.
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson yes, I wanted to say it's hard to believe, but I won't attack his credibility.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you so much.
MR BAHUMI:   Thank you.
WITNESS EXCUSED
CHAIRPERSON:   It remains then for us to just go through - is that all, Maribana?
MR MARIBANA:   That is all, Mr Chairman, but I would like to put on record that Kuntakana is available, as well as Manteko.  I just want to place on record that they are present.
CHAIRPERSON:   Fair enough.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Who was available?
MR MARIBANA:   Kuntakana, the herd boy and Manteko ...(indistinct)
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to get a list of the context of what the applicants are.  Mr Hugo, have you got a list of what your client is actually applying for?
MR HUGO:   Yes, Mr Chairman, if you could just bear with me.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well while you're looking - Mr Lamey, have you got any?  I think you gave us that.
MR LAMEY:   Chairperson, I've already covered that.
CHAIRPERSON:   You also gave it.
MR NEL:   Yes, Mr Chairman, I covered that in the evidence.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr van der Merwe?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Mr Chairman, I don't know if I gave it to you in regard to all my clients, may I just run through it for your assistance?
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.
MR VAN DER MERWE ADDRESSES:   As far as the involvement of - let me start at the top:  Johan Hendrik Tait - he just went to the fence, so I would say that his role in this matter would amount to conspiracy to murder ...
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   How many counts?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   That would be - well they thought there were three people, plus possibly three more.  It's very difficult to draw a distinction between structure Y and structure X.  I think in the planning stages anything was possible, they didn't plan to specifically kill the people, but it was foreseen ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Conspiracy to commit an undetermined number of murders.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   That is probably the correct way to word it, Mr Chairman.
CHAIRPERSON:   And then two murders?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Two murders, two attempted murders, malicious damage to property, as well as arson.
CHAIRPERSON:   How does an MITP come in here?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   I'm throwing it in as part of the net, Mr Chairman.  I will leave it at that, I will stick to arson.
CHAIRPERSON:   How many counts of arson would you say there are?  Three as I count them, maybe more, I don't know.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   It's difficult to distinguish because I don't think it is actually very clear as to how structure X caught alight.  The last witness, or the second-last witness indicated he thought it might have started as a result of the explosion or the explosives ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Well whatever, the probabilities that it was caused as a result of the attack.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   The actions of the members of the South African Police.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And as I recall there were three actual independent structures that caught alight, am I wrong?  Three.  The main house, one, the structure behind the main house and the structure in which these two witnesses were housed.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   As I have it, and I maybe I neglected to put it, structure Y, from what I've determined, was that there was never a thatched roof on it and there was nothing in it that could burn.  So it was only structure X and the rondawel that could burn.  Those are the only two ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   What about the main house?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   That's the main house, structure X is the main house.  Y is the facility that housed the fighters.
CHAIRPERSON:   The actual transit house?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Ja.  Well that's the ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that not burnt?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   No, that was half demolished by the explosion, but it didn't burn.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the explosion is arson, isn't it?
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Well it was the bomb explosion.  I don't know if I'd go so far as to say arson, but I mean I suppose if it causes a fire, that could be - it could get there.  I will accept that, because I mean the last witness is a person who survived out of that building, so it's quite clear that that building didn't burn.  He was taken out of the building.
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   And then the last one would be the illegal possession of firearms, ammunition and/or explosives, whichever the Committee might find.  Plus then also, in this instance, Mr Tait did not cross the border, but he was assisting other people to cross the border illegally.
	The exact same reasons would be also for Wilhelm Riaan Bellingan, because he was also just at the border post.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   And then as far as Mr Hoffman is concerned, I think it will also remain the same.  The difference being that he was actually on the scene and was an active member of the execution of this attack.
CHAIRPERSON:   But then he would be, in his case, not by assisting others to cross the border, he in fact crossed the border.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   He in fact crossed.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen.
MR JANSEN:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair ...(indistinct)
INTERPRETER:   The speaker's mike is not on.
MR JANSEN:   Sorry, Mr Chairman.  I'll hand it up to you in due course, I just want to read the way I frame how amnesty is sought.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you might as well hand it up without reading it because that's what I'm asking you to tell me, what your client's applying for.  ...(indistinct) go by that.
MR JANSEN ADDRESSES:   Yes.  It's for the murder of the two deceased, Mapua and Thika, and I have the full names here, then secondly, the attempted murder of - and initially I had the words:



		"all occupants of the dwellings attacked by the applicants on 11 December at Diratapeng, Botswana"



but I've inserted the names at the moment, so instead of all occupants of the dwellings, one can say the attempted murder of, and list the six people of whom there is evidence before the Committee.  And then thirdly, I've just stated in very general terms:



		"All other statutory or common law offences or delicts committed during, and as a result of the planning and execution of the attack."



and then just give the details of the attack.  I know as far as these broad - or let me put it this way, the different or the many different offences and delicts that can flow from an incident like that, it would appear that different Committees have different ways of dealing with it.  I leave that in your hands.  
	I was also reminded that Mr Ras also did testify to an assault on Mr, it would then have been Kuntakana Molema, in the run-up to the, or in the process of the surveillance of the house at the time that he was arrested by Mr Ras.  I'll ask for assault then in respect of Mr Kuntakana, during ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that part of his original application?
MR JANSEN:   No, but it was part of his evidence.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he didn't make an application for that assault, did he?
MR JANSEN:   Well Mr Chairman, I'll just have to check that, but as far as I remember it wasn't - that action ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Well check it, that's what I'm asking you.
MR JANSEN:   Yes.  But Mr Chairman, again the way I have understood the process to have developed, is that if - as long as one can bring one's offence more-or-less within the ambit of one's original application, Committees have been willing to grant amnesty for matters which are not strictly speaking within the ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Look, he didn't commit this assault on the day of the attack.
MR JANSEN:   No, no, it was ...
CHAIRPERSON:   So it's a separate incident, so it can't be fished out of a lake to come within the ambits of the application.
MR JANSEN:   No, I accept Mr Chair, that at some or other stage there must be a line ...(indistinct - no microphone)
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, precisely.
MR JANSEN:   ...(indistinct - no microphone) submit that this would be sufficiently linked to the planning of the incident ...  Sorry Mr Chairman.  My submission would simply be that that assault would be sufficiently linked to the incident as a whole.  If you disagree ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   So be it.
MR JANSEN:   So be it, yes.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   I don't think it's linked, Mr Jansen, I think that you are stretching yourself too far.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let's leave it like that.
JUDGE KHAMPEPE:   If I recall the evidence of Mr Ras, there was an attempt to carry out an operation with members of Special Forces, and this incident would be linked to that incident more than the incident which later transpired, but it wasn't part of the planning of this operation that Mr Thika was assaulted.
MR JANSEN:   Not in a direct sense, but I also submit that it wasn't in a direct sense linked to that other attack, Chair, I think it was simply linked in a direct way to the process of gaining information on those structures there and ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   You know Mr Jansen, when I used to practice I was told by one of my clients who claimed that he was assaulted, he said - you know he was arrested a couple of times by the Security Police in the area where I used to practice and as a matter of introduction he would get what they call "'n snop klap", isn't this what happened?  Just as a matter of introduction, to show who's boss.
MR JANSEN:   Yes, I accept that it's almost legend, yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   And it had nothing to do with whether this transit house was a transit house and whether it should be destroyed and whatever else happened, not so?
MR JANSEN:   No certainly it's a - one falls into that debate of what is necessary and what is not necessary and what can be regarded as political ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think you summed it up just now, that look, if I disagree with you, so be it, and let's leave it like that.  You've made your submissions, I've heard it and you've done your duty.
MR JANSEN:   Thank you, Chair.  If I can then just - I'll hand this to you just after the ...
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Cornelius, have you got submissions on this?
MR CORNELIUS ADDRESSES:   Yes, thank you Mr Chair.
	It will obviously be as far as the bomb inspector is concerned, or the bomb expert:  conspiracy to murder;  two murders;  ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Two attempted murders.
MR CORNELIUS:   Yes, the attempted murders I would also include all six, because we didn't know what would happen to the extent of the bomb, it could have killed anybody on the premises.  One arson of the lapa area.  And then I've still got a bit of difficulty with malicious damage to property.  If the bomb in fact did cause the fire, then obviously it will be arson of the two other structures as well.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if the bomb would have even scorched the wall, then that's arson.
MR CORNELIUS:   Yes, if that is the Committee's view, I agree with that.  And then obviously:  all contraventions under the Act on Explosives;  all delicts - as you've indicated already.  And then the illegal entering and crossing of a border.  Which I think is part and parcel of my whole amnesty application.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hugo.
MR HUGO:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  
	We agree with the list that Mr Jansen has just handed up, except that - that's in respect of both Mr de Kock and Mr Radebe, Simon Radebe - I'm not sure whether defeating the ends of justice was contained in that list.  We're also applying for that. 
	Mr Chairman, and then, I suppose it's not really necessary to itemise it, but the possession of the landmine that was taken across, would also form part and parcel of what we're seeking amnesty for.
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I was thinking of putting that under the explosives ...(indistinct).  Mr Hugo, it didn't cross my mind about the defeating the ends of justice, but where was that crime, or how was that crime committed?
MR HUGO:   Well we would argue, Mr Chairman, that there was a duty on them to disclose ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   As policemen?
MR HUGO:   As policemen.  ... to disclose that they were involved in an illegal operation etcetera, and that they were crossing ...(intervention)
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they testify at any hearing or tribunal to that effect?
MR HUGO:   Mr Chairman, amongst the issues that came to the fore with the Harms Commission, for instance.
CHAIRPERSON:   And they denied it under oath.
MR HUGO:   Yes.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then that will ...
MR HUGO:   Thank you.  Mr Chairman, Mr de Kock has just made me aware of the fact that maybe there was another one, and that's perjury, in the sense that during the Harms Commission they were explicitly asked whether they partook in these sort-of operations.
ADV BOSMAN:   Are you now referring to Mr de Kock and Mr Radebe both?
MR HUGO:   Only Mr de Kock in respect of the perjury incident.
ADV BOSMAN:   Yes, but you used the term "we" - or "they" actually.  Thank you.
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Have we come to the stage of argument now?  No more evidence.  Mr Maribana, what's your attitude towards the applications?  Or let me ask Ms Patel first.  What's your attitude to the applications?
MS PATEL:   Well Honourable Chairperson, in light of the concessions that have been made by the victims, I don't believe I have any argument in this matter.
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you agree that this is a case for granting?
MS PATEL:   Yes.
NO ARGUMENT BY MS PATEL
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Maribana, have you got any argument or any reason to submit that it should be refused?
MR MARIBANA IN ARGUMENT:   As it pleases the Honourable Chairperson.
	Mr Chairperson, I've got instructions, more in particular from Mr Abraham Thika, the father of Rapula Thika, Mr Chairperson, to oppose amnesty.
CHAIRPERSON:   Only on that one, or?
MR MARIBANA:   Only on that matter, Mr Chairperson.
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what do you have to say about that?
MR MARIBANA:   Mr Chairperson, on reasons that Rapula Thika, Mr Chairperson, wasn't involved in politics at all, and it is my humble submission to that, that fact wasn't put into dispute by the applicants.
CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.
MR MARIBANA:   Mr Chairperson, I've just stated that that fact wasn't put in dispute by the applicants, that Rapula was involved in politics, Mr Chairperson.  I won't drag it further, Mr Chairperson, I'll leave it there.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Yes, we don't need to hear any other argument from anybody else.  This matter is adjourned.
	All that is left for me is to thank everybody for showing interest in the process, and to thank especially the logistics people and the interpreters, who often work to exhaustion, and to those people who have provided the food for us to survive.  And those who have travelled far to attend this hearing, I also wish to thank them for the effort made.
MR VAN DER MERWE:   Excuse me Chairman, there's something that I neglected on behalf of Mr Hoffman and I just want to shortly address something to the family of Rapula, specifically.  His instruction to me is - unfortunately he had to leave urgently on business - is that despite the fact that he believes that he should qualify for amnesty in this matter, he does apologise to the family of the deceased, Rapula, because of the fact that this was an innocent boy, as was rightly put by the attorney for the family, who was caught up in the crossfire in this incident, and that he wishes to express his sincere regret to the family of this boy.  He cannot unfortunately take it further.   He cannot make this boy come to life again, but he does wish to express his sincere condolences with the family.  Thank you, Mr Chair.
CHAIRPERSON:   With that then we'll adjourn this hearing.
