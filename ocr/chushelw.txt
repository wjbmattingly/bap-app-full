-------------------------------------------------------

CHAIRPERSON:	Is there anybody from yesterday who has not testified
yet?	What is your name?

MR NUBA: Jongindlu Theophilus Nuba.

CHAIRPERSON: Your name is here Sir, from yesterday's list. Please come
onto the stage.	Is there somebody else from yesterday?	We will have to
wait for a statement.

MPHELANQU CHUSHELWA: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Mphelanqu Cheba you have heard yesterday's evidence. Is
there something that you would like to add?

MR CHUSHELWA: 	Thank you Mr Chairperson. I would like to add, but before
I add to the evidence, yesterday's evidence was the truth indeed but in
Pondoland the root of the whole problem....

	From 1959 Pondo people became violent because of what I am going to say.

	The first court was in Nonqulana. This is where the Pondo people met for
the first time to arise against the Government of the day. This place was
called Nonqulana. It is the name of the mountain. This is why people said
the Pondo people are gathering at Nonqulana.

	The second mountain was Ndlovu, the third Ngquza. 	The root of this
problem started at Nonqulana. My

wish is that that mountain, Nonqulana should be commemorated one way or
another. There should be some form of a tombstone perhaps because
everything started at Nonqulana.

	Look, the white man has Vasco da Gama, Jan van Riebeeck. The black man
was not educated and enlightened about their history. This is why I say
this mountain, there must be a monument there. This is what I would like
to add.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for enlightening us. This is what

we want. As you have listened to the evidence, if

there is something that is not clarified you have clarified it for us.
Thank you Sir for such wisdom.

	I thought that Ngquza was also referred to as Nonqulana. Now you have
clarified things for us.

	Thank you.
