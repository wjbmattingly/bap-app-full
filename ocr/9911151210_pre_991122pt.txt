 TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
 AMNESTY HEARING
DATE:	22ND NOVEMBER 1999
MATTER:	MURDER OF M K VALDEZ - POSTPONEMENT
DAY:		5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------CHAIRPERSON:   We were due to hear the matter referred to as the Killing of MK Valdez, Simon Kolele, this morning, but having considered the papers before us and having discussed the matter with lawyers appearing for the applicants for the victims and the Evidence Leader we have decided that it would be desirable to attempt to obtain further information as to whether it is possible to obtain the case docket and the inquest report and a post-mortem report as to the body, if this was performed and we are accordingly going to adjourn today's hearing to 9.30 tomorrow morning to enable the Leader of Evidence, assisted by the attorney for the victims, to proceed to the places where these documents are likely to be available, to inquire as to whether they are in fact available and if so to obtain copies which we can make use of during the hearing.  
	It was felt it would be preferable to obtain these before, rather than to proceed on the basis of the applications that are before us at the moment and thereafter to find that there are other facts which require explanation, so I am sorry and I apologise to members of the public who have come here today in the expectation of hearing this matter, but I can assure you that we have considered very carefully what the best things would be and we have decided that this is it, so we are now going to adjourn till half past nine tomorrow morning.
MS LOCKHAT:   Thank you Chairperson.
