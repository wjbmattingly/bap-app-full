 AMNESTY HEARING
DATE:			10 JULY 2000
NAME:			JERRY RICHARDSON
APPLICATION NO: 	AM7511/97
HELD AT:			JISS CENTRE, JOHANNESBURG
DAY:				4
_____________________________________________________CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon everybody.  We were to start today with the application of Mr Richardson which was postponed at the end of last year to continue with the same.  I must apologise that we have experienced hiccups in the process that the latest is before I go to what happened first is that the Department of Correctional Services say they don't have transportation to bring Mr Richardson here.  Despite us having sent the Witness Protection people, they insist that they have, because he is a maximum security prisoner, whatever that means, that they have to transport him themselves, so we cannot have Mr Richardson here.  The first hitch was that they had not received a requisition from Cape Town, that is from our offices. That was immediately done but now it's the question of transport.  We must apologise to everybody who came this morning to this hearing, that this is something that is beyond us but we have heard that they have given us an undertaking that tomorrow at 9 he would be here, that is Mr Richardson. I say we would adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at 9 a.m.  We are all saying it's beyond us all. We are sorry about this. Thank you.
MR RICHARD:   Thank you Chairperson.  May I mention another matter that is on roll for this week and that is the application of Tshepo Stanley Buhali and John Itumeleng Dube.  Is there no chance that we might be able to dispose of that one this afternoon?
CHAIRPERSON:   I asked because I was sitting with other Committee Members that they would be heard this week but for some reason Mr Mapoma says the legal representative of the two says there has been no formal notice whereas it was expressly postponed to this week, but he says he will attempt to be here sometime this week because he is now involved in a hearing in Pretoria.
MR RICHARD:   Thank you Chairperson, I will be here for the week it seems.
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mapoma, did I misrepresent you?
MR MAPOMA:   No Chairperson, that is precisely what has happened.
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.
MR MAPOMA:   Thank you, Sir.
CHAIRPERSON:   We formally adjourn.
