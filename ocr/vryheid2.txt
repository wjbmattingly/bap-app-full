PROCEEDINGS RESUMED ON 1997/04/17

CHAIRPERSON: Good morning to you today. We would like to apologise. As
you have noticed that we are just sitting and no one is talking to each
other I am sure you are surprised what's going on. We are waiting for the
witnesses. Seemingly they aren't here. The only witness which is around
is Mr Buthelezi, and that's why we're still waiting. We're waiting for at
least two more witnesses to come, therefore we ask you to be please
patient. Thank you.

MACHINE SWITCHED OFF

ON RESUMPTION:

CHAIRPERSON: (Inaudible) ... here with us who are taking statements, and
we will request that those who are here and who want to give their
statements in, they can see our statement-takers at that side where I am
pointing. That's where they can be seated. If you are here and you want
to give in your statement you can go there so that you can give your
statement, and then come back and sit down and listen to the witnesses
who've already gave their statements. Thank you. We came to a conclusion
that we will go for a tea, and then when we come back we don't have to go
for a tea until lunch time. We're trying to save time because we've
wasted time already. Then we will go for a tea now, and then we will go
on - after the tea we will go on until lunch time, until 1 o'clock. We
all agree that this is the best solution we can come up with. It's better
that we go for a tea. It's now 10 to 10. I hope that at about 10 past 10
we will come back, or five past 10 we will be back, and then we will
continue from there until 1 o'clock, until lunch time.

	/As we've

As we've apologised yesterday that the tea has been prepared for the
witnesses and their families. The tea has been prepared for the witnesses
and their families and the TRC staff members, and those who are here to
help, like the counsellors and the briefers. Those are the only people
who can have tea. We would like to apologise to those who cannot get the
tea. Thanks a lot. 10 past 10 we will be back. Thank you.

SHORT ADJOURNMENT

	---------------------

ON RESUMPTION:

CHAIRPERSON: Please be seated. We are about to begin. We will ask Pastor
Zama to open this meeting by word of prayer.

MEETING OPENS WITH SINGING AND PRAYERS

CHAIRPERSON: We have already said good morning to you. Maybe we should
apologise for the delay. We know our places are far apart, and we don't
have our private transport, we rely largely on the public transport. I
would like to apologise on that note. We have already started late and
therefore we won't adjourn for tea break, we will only adjourn for lunch.
I am sure this will suit all of us.

There is one aspect that we would like to pay attention to. We would ask
for each and every one of you in this hall to pay full attention, listen
properly to the names, to the areas which they refer to, so that when we
leave this place we do not at all distort any message. Yesterday it has
so happened that one of the witnesses who came up to render his or her
testimony, and at the time one name was implicated, Siphiwe Nxumalo, and
it happened

	/that

that that very name was similar to the name of one of our prominent
figures here in Mondlo, and he got a telephone call that his name was
implicated at the Commission by one of the witnesses who was rendering
his or her testimony. He was very offended. I am sure you understand that
when you receive anonymous calls one gets offended. Fortunately we
managed to sort that one out. We managed to locate the person who took
the message to Siphiwe, and we had to rectify that error and we were able
to. The Siphiwe that was referred to is not the one of Mondlo. Please pay
full attention, and if there is anything that you do not understand at
all do not go around and say your own version and give a fabricated one.
Please pay attention to names and attention to details at the same time
that you may not distort any message and give a fabricated version.

Without much waste of time we will call upon our first witness to come up
and occupy the witness stand by the name of Harriet Jabulile Mcetywa.

	---------------------























	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, Mrs Harriet Mcetywa, for coming. Maybe we should
first thank you for coming forward to this Commission and render your own
testimony with regard to Michael Zolani Mcetywa, and which affects you
directly. Before we get started we will kindly ask you to stand up so you
may take the oath.

	---------------------

HARRIET MCETYWA (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: The one who is going to lead your evidence is Mr Ilan Lax,
and now I will hand over to Mr Ilan Lax.

MR LAX: Good morning Mrs Mcetywa. --- Good morning to you.

We thank you for coming. I know you've had to travel quite far to get
here, and we're grateful for that. Now, just by way of family details,
you have given us all the details of your children, and you have two
daughters and a son, is that correct? Now, the incidents that you are
going to tell us about happened in the Pongola area. INTERPRETER: The
witness is not getting any interpretation at all. I don't think she hears
whatever we say. --- When we got to Pongola - I was born in Soweto, and
we left with my husband to Pongola, and that's where we built our home.
We were there and the situation was stable, and after violence had
erupted now chaos started. From there my husband was being hunted by the
boers, white policemen, and boers from Piet Retief, Mahamba and Pongola
were after my husband. We never had a pleasant stay at all. He was
working at a cotton firm where he was a manager, and he resigned and
started our own business. Because of the harassment due to the boers ...
(intervention)

	/Please

Please just stop for one second. Sorry, we ... (inaudible) ... because
what you're saying has to be translated ... (inaudible) ... now if I can
just take you back quickly. You said that this violence erupted. What
violence was this and why did it erupt? --- This violence was caused by
him, because he is the one who started the ANC in the area, and the area
was predominantly IFP. And from there we experienced harsh life, and
boers will come and raid our home, searching for weapons. And from there
he was being followed by the boers, and the boers were forever after him,
and therefore the customers, our customers, were affected. They could not
come to our saloon, because we were owning a business saloon. In November
1993 there were rumours that he was going to be killed, and he was no
longer free at all from that time. And one time when he was in town one
man approached him and took a picture of him. He got back home very
worried about that action, because the person who took the picture of him
ran away soon after that. After a few days being harassed, and police
searching our home now and again, and scared for our lives, on the 20th,
1993, November, one person who was working hand in hand with him as a
secretary came to our home to tell us that some men came to the business
and told her that they were looking for my husband and he will be killed.
And we were frightened in that fashion often, and on the 5th - I am
sorry, on the 19th November he went to visit the children in Swaziland.
He felt so much in miss of them, and he went to Swaziland and back on
Sunday. And the bus strike erupted and there was a bus boycott, and it
was alleged that he was the one behind that. And they alleged as well

	/that it

that it was ANC behind that. I told him that maybe we should go back home
in Johannesburg because we are not at all at peace here, and he refused
to listen to me. We continued living in this area. On the 20th November
1993 Krish Ndwandwe arrived, and he was relating his own story as well
that there were people trying to attack him, and he went to town. No,
they both went to town with Krish's wife as well, and when they got to
town they left him at Ellerine's Furniture shop, only to find that the
attacker was there, the perpetrator, following him. After a short
distance he stopped to talk to someone there, and the killer came behind
him. And he looked back and saw this man, and suddenly he shot, and shot
the second time, and my husband fell right then. He was shot 10 times.
That wasn't the end of the story. After that I saw a crowd of people
running, coming to my house, and yet in the morning he had told me that
he wasn't feeling so well, he was feeling depressed. And when he left,
going now by the gate, he stopped and waved at me, and little did I know
that that was the last wave. I went to town, because I saw people
running, coming to my house, and I was surprised what was happening. I
wasn't too sure what was happening, and I didn't know that that was the
time when he will die. I saw a crowd of people coming to my house, and
they got in. I asked what had happened. No one responded, but they told
me that something of this sort has happened. I left, I went to town, and
he was lying down dead, and the boers refused me to come anywhere close
to him. He was shot at 11 in the morning right in front of the Protea
Furniture shop's personnel. I couldn't come any closer to get close to
him. I went back home and

	/there

there was a crowd of people in my premises. I didn't know what to do. At
about 11 - no, at 11 he was shot, and was left like that up until 6.00
pm. In the afternoon I tried to go to the police station, the mortuary,
but still they refused me. And after that I consulted the family to let
them know of the tragedy. From that point we - he died on Monday, and on
Wednesday there were Comrades all over singing, and there was a white
policeman that drove by and shot at the Comrades using rubber bullets. At
that time some of my relatives had already arrived, but not all of them,
and they took two of those Comrades who were shot by the police. It was
on Wednesday the 23rd. The two Comrades were taken to Juba Hospital and
were given preliminary treatment. We made preparations for the funeral,
and there were rumours that he was going to be burned, his corpse will be
burned and won't be buried the proper way, the right way. Before the
funeral IFP people slaughtered cattle in town, and were so excited about
his death, but I did say that God is alive, and one day it will hit back
on them. We went on ahead with the funeral preparations, and people were
not so free to come to my house to help us as we were preparing for the
funeral. However, some did come. On Saturday at about nine I asked the
ANC people, Senzo Mchunu, to provide security because I did anticipate
trouble on that day. On Saturday security indeed arrived, and they only
had one gun. And at the same time the relatives and the neighbours were
busy peeling the vegetables, preparing lunch for that day, and there were
a few men who came in wearing jackets, and there were five of them. They
shot people, and people - some of them ran away. And there was a police
vehicle

	/parked

parked by, and what amazed us was that the vehicle took off before the
shooting spree, and got back after that. I still thanked my God because
no one died on that day. After that the station commander of Pongola
Police Station, Meiring, came and was complimenting us about the house,
our beautiful house we have. And I was worried and concerned about the
safety of the people outside, but he wasn't worried about the safety of
the people, which was a cause for concern. Nothing happened anyways. On
Sunday morning - because I decided that as early as eight we will have
the funeral so people will be free to leave earlier -we saw three people
approaching to our house, coming from a forest, and they were driving a
Ford Sierra with registration NO. And that car was driving up and down,
threatening to shoot, and there were helicopters and soldiers patrolling
the area and fortunately they were arrested, those guys. We therefore
went on with our funeral arrangements and we buried my husband. Relatives
left and went back to their respective places and I remained with my
children and with the three of us.

(Inaudible) ... you can continue. (Pause) You've told us about the
funeral and what happened. Now, after that we understand there were some
problems. --- When my husband was still alive he refused to give land to
- or premises to the boers for ANC offices, and he met with the ANC
people ... (incomplete)

INTERPRETER: The interpreter did not get that.

MR LAX: Sorry, there's some confusion in the way what you've said has
been interpreted. Now, what I understand you to be saying is that your
husband had a problem getting premises for the ANC, and so he decided to
use

	/your

your garage for that purpose. Is that correct? --- That is correct.

Please continue from there. --- They used the garage for the ANC and in
preparation of the elections. Soon after that there were still rumours
about me, that I should be burnt in the house because I had turned my
house into an ANC nest. I survived still with my three children and one
lady who was my helper. Those days were bitter to me, and I do trust and
hope that if I still had parents I would have moved back in with my
parents. The office went on and continued, and they were driving their
cars, passing by, and ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 1) ...
children, and I called Senzo Mchunu in Empangeni and told him that I was
not happy at all, I would appreciate if he could make arrangements for
the security. Fortunately Senzo sent two boys by the name of Sbu Shandu
and the other one was Stanley Gcwabe. The third one was Simelane, who was
the one heading the office. The office carried on in spite of those
difficulties, and when the case was to be ... (inaudible) ... in March
1994, when I arrived I parked my car in the garage as usual. I offloaded
the stock which I have bought for the saloon and I put the stock inside
the house. The next day I went to the case. It was in Pongola Court. When
I arrived ... (intervention)

(Inaudible) --- That's correct.

The person who was charged was Emmanuel Nkosinathi Mavuso, is that right?
--- That is correct.

Just for the record at this stage, is it correct that he was sentenced to
25 years in gaol? --- That is correct.

For the murder of your husband. --- That is correct.

Is it also correct that at present - he escaped while on bail? --- That
is correct.

(Inaudible) --- I never heard anything after that. The last time I heard
is that police were looking for him because he had escaped bail. In June
last year I met him in Vryheid in OK, and he saw me, I was with my child,
and then he followed me. I went to the police station and I parked my car
there, and then he passed. After he passed me I drove home. I went to the
ANC offices, I reported the matter, and I told them I wasn't satisfied
about this case because I am still feeling bad, it's still sad to me.
From there I never heard anything up until today. I don't even know where
the murderer is.

Just for the record, the police are still looking for this man, and -
it's not clear how hard they're actually looking for him at this stage
because he has been seen in the area. Now you were telling us about
having gone to the case. You then came back from the case. What happened
after that? --- Which case are you referring to? Mavuso's case? When we
were in court - we arrived there, and I had no one accompanying me
because people were scared to accompany me, they feared their lives, and
they thought that they were going to be killed because I was known as a
woman of ANC. I was with my daughter, my first-born, who is 17 now. We
arrived there and we found Inkatha people inside the court. Most people
in there were Inkatha people, and they refused that ANC people should go
inside. I was the only one allowed. Inside people were swearing at me.
The case was remanded. I left the court. There were Comrades outside the
court,

	/they

they were waiting there in cars, and there were also buses full of
Inkatha members. There were many. There were buses from Dumbe, and vans.
Outside the court one person known as Zanda Hlangamandla came to me, and
then he spit at my face and he pointed his finger at me. I went back to
the court because I was scared. Police were just watching and doing
nothing. One white policeman came and he helped me. He pushed these
people and I went to my car. I drove back home. It was on the 4th of
March. It was about 10 o'clock. I decided to drive down to Swaziland to
bring my children's clothes. I didn't sleep in Swaziland, I came back. At
about 9 o'clock in border gate in Golela I phoned the security, I asked
them how was it in the township, and they told me the situation was bad,
I must be careful. God protected me until home. I parked my car in the
garage. I went inside my bathroom and then I took a bath. After I
finished taking a bath I served the guys I was staying with, I gave them
food. One of them noticed me that I was troubled, and we all knew that
Themba Khoza has just passed next to my house and pointed at my house. He
was together with other IFP members. When I was inside my house these
guys said to me, "Sister Jabu, you mustn't go outside. Outside the
situation is real bad." Police cars were outside from Pongola Police
Station, and kombis, about eight of them, with soldiers, Shangani
soldiers, and boers, and Inkatha members as well. They were in uniform. I
took a pillow, I went to my sitting-room. That's where I slept on my
couch. I fell asleep and I heard a knock at the kitchen door. When I
heard this knock these guys told me I mustn't go outside because the
situation was real bad, and

	/all these

all these people who came by kombis were surrounding my house. I went
back to the lounge and they told me to turn off the lights. I turned off
the lights and it was dark. Sbu Shandu got up the tree, climbed the tree,
and the other one went and stood next to the bedroom, the other one next
to the garage. When I was still lying on my couch I heard a gunfire
hitting the front door. I got scared. I stood up. A big hole at that
door. I went to the bedroom, I took a telephone and I made a call to the
police, and the police told me there are no cars. That's because they
were the ones who were surrounding my house. I heard gunfire. It was the
guys whom I was staying with and the policemen. The gunfire went on until
4.00 am. Other shots were coming through the windows at my house. I lay
down on my stomach and then they started throwing hand grenades inside my
house. I saw a fire from the sitting-room and the dining-room, and then
they went inside my child's bedroom. The house was on fire and I was
inside the house, I couldn't run outside. I went to the main bedroom, I
opened the wardrobe, I got inside. I heard footsteps and I could tell
that they were coming towards the bedroom. There was a smoke, fire, I was
dizzy. I couldn't do anything. And outside gunfire were still on. These
guys were shooting the police and the police were shooting them. One
policeman got injured, a black policeman. His name was Ndlovu. He is at
Pongola Police Station. I went to the kitchen. I was trying to get out
because I was scared that even if I am inside I am going to be burnt by
the fire. When I got outside they heard that the door was being opened.
They fired at the door. I went to the refrigerator, next to the

	/refrigerator.

refrigerator. I could smell the gas from the refrigerator, and I
suspected that it was going to explode. I went outside. When I was
outside I was shot and God helped me, protected me, because I didn't get
injured. I went to a neighbour's house. Outside my neighbour's house I
hide myself on the grass. They tried to look for me, they couldn't find
me. Before all these things happened I took my car keys with me inside my
gown pocket. People stopped me in the morning to go inside my house, but
I refused, I went on, I checked my house. They also burnt my saloon, my
business, and it was the only income I was depending on. And what I had
in the saloon, the stock was about amounting to R10 000,00. I found a
tape in the yard, and boers were inside my house. They were about 20 of
them. They refused me to go inside my house, so I told them, "I am going
to get inside my house. This is my house." No one answered me. Senzo
Mchunu came together with security from Empangeni. He talked with these
boers, and my house was burnt and everything inside my house was damaged.
I was left with the gown I was wearing. I asked them to accompany me to
the bank so that I withdraw some money and buy something to wear. I
decided to go back to Johannesburg. I went back to Johannesburg. After
that these security guys stayed there in my house. When I was in
Johannesburg I heard that they wanted to exhume my husband's body, and I
tried to talk to these security guys to make sure that they don't do
that. I stayed at home in 1994 after I left, because I left in 1994
April. I went back to Pongola again after they burnt my house because I
couldn't stay nice in Johannesburg. My heart was back in Pongola. I
decided to go back to

	/Pongola.

Pongola. I reported the matter to Senzo. I asked them to look for a place
for me to stay. Then I decided to renovate two rooms of my house. I
renovated that two rooms. One lawyer from Pongola, his name is Plant, he
helped me. He bought paint and doors for me. I stayed there with my kids.
Elections came and I was chosen as a councillor. After that what happened
last year in December, the Truth Commission people came to take a
statement. SABC people came to interview me about the violence in the
area, because I was one of the members of the ANC there. After that I got
threats that I was going to be shot and follow my husband, and even my
children they still experience harassment from Inkatha Youth, and they
still tell them that, "Who killed your father? You will follow your
father." And this thing is really tormenting my children. Even today they
aren't in a good situation. In December I went to Jozini. A 4x4, a
certain 4x4, powder blue in colour, followed me, and then it overtaken
me. I slowed down. It followed me until Jozini. At Jozini I drove to
those people I was supposed to drop there. I was suspecting this 4x4. I
went to the police station in Jozini. I noticed this van, and luckily
enough when I went to make a call these people were coming to my
direction, but the phones were not working so I couldn't make a phone
call. Then I left. This very same 4x4 followed me, so they knew I was
going to go back to Pongola. There's only one route from Jozini to
Pongola. They followed me again, they tried to shoot me. They couldn't
shoot me, they just shot my car. I accelerated. When I got into the
T-junction I found a red car standing parked there and I couldn't
overtake it, but I tried my

	/best,

best, so I accelerated. When I got into the town I checked my car. I made
a call to Durban to the ANC offices in Durban. I couldn't get any
assistance. I was staying there unsafe. I continued staying under those
difficult conditions, and then I decided to stay there and die there with
my children. In December a certain guy, IFP member, was killed, and I
wasn't there. When I came back I heard that there was a guy who was
killed, an IFP member. So I stayed there, I didn't want to run back to
Johannesburg. I said I was tired of running away. I was tired of sleeping
in hotels, and I have been reporting all these matters to my own
organisation, to other people, and I can't get any assistance, so I
decided that I will rather die here. One night I was sleeping with my
children. A kombi got there and they started firing. We woke up, me and
my children. I took my children, I actually threw them out the window,
and I saw the kombi driving back. And I took clothes and I took them to
the boot of my car and then I drove back to Johannesburg. I reported this
as well to my organisation, but there was no assistance.

Thank you, Mrs Mcetywa. A lot of the stuff you have been telling us about
happened really after the time - well, some of the later stuff happened
after the time that we can look at. We have allowed you to continue to
tell that story because it is a continuation of the earlier story. I just
want to take you back a little bit to clear up one or two things. Firstly
with regard to the attack on your house, you've said that a policeman by
the name of Ndlovu was injured in that attack. I can also tell you that
from our investigations a white policeman, a white

	/defence

defence force - or a soldier was also injured. Were the people who were
defending your house - have they ever been charged in a court? --- No,
they were not.

Do you know why the police launched this attack at your house? What were
they wanting to do there? --- No, I don't know why they came to my house.
They never answered me back when I asked them.

What they've told our investigators is that they were wanting to conduct
a search for unlawful firearms. It seems a bit of a funny way to conduct
a search, to attack your house. Now, I understand that you have made a
case against the police through lawyers in Durban. --- That is correct.

Is that case for the death of your husband and the damage to your house,
or what? --- It is for the damages of my house. For my husband I couldn't
because the suspect or the person who killed my husband was sentenced.

Thank you. One other area I thought I would just clear up with you. When
I asked you about the violence and how it had started what was
interpreted was that the violence was started by your husband because he
started an ANC branch in the area. --- That is correct. 	(Inaudible) ---
According to my knowledge he never conducted any violence. He was always
negotiating with people, and he couldn't suspect that he has got enemies.

(Inaudible) ... violence started in response to the ANC forming a branch
in the area? --- That is correct, it was in response, because he was the
one who was recruiting members for ANC.

	/Apart

Apart from the case against the murderer of your husband have you laid
any other criminal charges against the police or any other people? ---
No, because I used to report all matters to the people in Durban, and the
Truth and Reconciliation people came and took a statement from me. I am
still waiting to know what to do.

Okay. Our investigators are busy looking into the case, and we are making
quite good progress in getting to the bottom of it. Thank you, Mrs
Mcetywa, thank you, Chairperson. --- There is one thing I want to tell
you about a policeman called Mkwanazi. He is the one who started these
allegations that there were guns in my house, and I also suspected that
he was the one that was driving that 4x4 which followed me and shot at my
car. Even today I am not safe here in Natal. I am not going anywhere, I
am scared to go out.

Mrs Mcetywa, we did give Mr Mkwanazi notice that you had accused him, and
through his lawyers he has replied. He denies being involved in any
conspiracy to kill your husband, and he denies being involved in any
activities against you personally. However, his lawyers have asked us for
more details, some of which we refused to give him because we wanted to
protect your safety, and they have said that because we wouldn't give
them more detail they could not answer the allegations, all of them. So I
just place that on the record at this stage. --- I have to say this about
Mr Mkwanazi because he is the one who usually came to my house with this
white policeman, and when my husband died, even though he was working far
from Piet Retief he was here all of a sudden. When my house was burnt he
was there. That's why I am saying I am very

	/much

much sure that he is the one who was behind all this violence. And also
Mr Mavuso said the gun that he used to kill my husband he got the gun
from Mr Mkwanazi.

(Inaudible) ... further allegations about Mr Mkwanazi please. We are
investigating this matter, and we will be discussing it further with his
lawyers and with himself, and we want to give him an opportunity to
respond to the allegations that you have made. So I will ask that you
don't say anything further about him at this stage. --- Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Mrs Batshabulile(?), we compliment you for the courage that
you have above everything what happened to you, and you still have the
courage to come here and talk about these things. It's so sad to realise
that before people who tried to stand for the truth, and people who
fought for justice, were so unfortunate, were the ones who suffered most.
At the time even the people we had our hopes on that will protect us they
failed us, because the way they went on with things was not satisfactory
to us. Even your children we do trust and hope that they will be fine,
and we can tell that they are brave enough because they have stood all
what has happened to you in the past. And we do trust and hope that as we
are entering into this new era, or rather have entered into this era, the
Commission will do its best to disclose of all what has happened, and tie
the past with the present and the future, and see how we'll go on, how
will we carry on in the new era. I would like for you to respond in as
far as ... (incomplete - end of Side B, Tape 1) --- Since their dad
passed away they experience problems, especially that we are destitute,
and

	/in the

in the place where we reside we from time to time encounter problems.
Even now this very term they are not back at school. I don't have money
to pay for their fees. Only the last one is at school. And the other one
who is suffering from asthma, each time he talks or thinks about his
father he gets affected.

What about the one who is at school? How old is the child? --- She or he
is 10 and he's in standard three. He or she is right here at Eshowe, and
the other two are in Pretoria since this year. Those are the ones I am
referring to when I say I could not pay for their fees. They are still at
home and could not go back to school.

We have heard that you lost about R10 000,00 worth of stock and other
harassment that you've made mention of. Tell us about you. How are you
faring as far as your health is concerned? --- I have suffered a great
deal in the past. I went to Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg and I
got treatment from the doctors there. I am still hurt inside, and I have
this wound right deep inside. However, I am faring better.

Have you tried to get in touch with the psychologists, those who look
into the traumas that people suffered? --- I haven't gone to the
psychologist because I have heard that I will have to have a certain
amount of money, and money I don't have so that has discouraged me. As
for now I can't afford to consult with the psychologist. I go to any
general practitioner for a day's treatment and that's all.

We will kindly ask you to get in touch with the briefers. The lady seated
right on your left will help you and advise you as to how to go about to
receive help.

	/Even

Even your children need attention, and we are concerned that you get in
touch with the briefer so you get all that help. Thank you for your
bravery, and also thank you for standing for the truth, and for being so
determined and coming up to this Commission and render your testimony.
Yes, these things did transpire. We know about those things and we do
trust and hope that in the future things like that won't emanate again.
Thank you.

	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: Our next witness is B J Buthelezi, and may he come to the
witness stand. Good morning, Mr Buthelezi.

MR BUTHELEZI: Good morning to you.

CHAIRPERSON: You are here to tell us your story.

MR BUTHELEZI: Yes, that is true.

CHAIRPERSON: Maybe we should get started first with the oath.

	---------------------

BONGANI BUTHELEZI (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: We will ask Mr Mdu Dlamini to lead your evidence.

MR DLAMINI: Good morning, Mr Buthelezi. Mr Buthelezi, maybe we should
start first about your family. Give us a picture of your family. We do
have the names of the children that you have furnished us with, however
we don't know anything about the mother, or perhaps the mothers, of the
children. Maybe I should help you. Are you married? --- No, I am not
married.

What about the kids, do you live with the kids or they live with their
mothers? --- No, they are with their mothers.

Do you still have parents? --- Yes.

What about your mother and your father? --- I will say unfortunately they
are separated, they do not stay together.

Please lift up your volume so you may be audible enough, especially that
the people in this hall are listening to you, not to the translation. ---
I would like to explain that unfortunately my parents have separated. My
mum is in Coronation and my father is in Johannesburg.

	/do you

Do you have brothers or sisters? --- Yes, I do. I will say I have eight
sisters and brothers, but one died last year in September. Now we are
seven left.

The one who died what happened? Was he sick, or perhaps killed in some
attack? --- No, he was sick.

We are sorry to hear that, Mr Buthelezi, but we do say it's better to die
from some kind of illness or sickness instead of being killed in attacks
or in any violence of some kind. Your matter is with regard to yourself
and the torture you received under the hands of the police, and arrested.
Also you were given petrol to drink. --- Yes, that's correct.

And also the telephone calls that were threats to you. We will ask you to
lay your story, starting from 1994 when you were residing here in Mondlo.
I will keep interrupting, and by doing so that will be an effort of
trying to explain a point or so. Go on ahead. I will keep interposing.
--- I will apologise first. I had asked the Commission that I have three
statements that I would like to represent. I would say I would like to
explain about two statements before I go back to 1994. I have a 1995
statement and a 1993 statement, though I did not write those statements.
I wrote one statement, not three different statements, but I explained
that on the 15th, on Monday.

Before I answer you, you say you have three statements. Do you mean you
have three different incidents that happened over and above your arrest,
and the petrol bombs issues, and the threats, telephone calls that were
threats? Over and above that do you still have any other incidents? ---
Yes, I do.

	/Before

Before us we only have the ones that appear - the incidents that appear
in the statement. I will advise you to get in touch with the statement
takers, who will connect and combine the two. As for today please talk
about what we have here, because that will be difficult for us if you
will talk about things that we don't have here in the statement, so stick
to what we have here in the statement. --- I will like to apologise, I
also have another question. Is it advisable that I should disclose of any
names even when something is embarrassing? Am I allowed to disclose?

If that name appears in your statement you are free to mention any names,
but the names that you shouldn't even touch are the names that don't
appear in your statement. However, whatever is in the statement you are
free to make mention of it at any time whilst rendering your testimony.
--- Thank you. I will first start in 1994, on the 13th March 1994. I was
here in this very hall at night, and there was a wedding. One of my
uncles has a wedding band, and he plays that band, and that band plays
for different weddings, and we were in this very hall in that night on
Friday. That was Friday evening on the 13th March 1994. It was about 2.00
to 3.00 am and we left, we went to Mondlo. I slept in the car. I didn't
get inside the house and I didn't even go home. We were at my uncle's
place or area. Around eight in the morning I had to leave after I have
packed the instruments of the band. I was an observer of the ANC.

INTERPRETER: The interpreter was left behind.

MR DLAMINI: Please repeat right there. You say you were an observer. ---
Yes, I was a member of the ANC Youth,

	/and I

and I was an observer.

Go on ahead. --- It so happened that on that day, on the 13th in the
morning around eight, I left my uncle's place and went home after
offloading the instruments. When I got to this section at B I saw a crowd
of people coming from Mlaba, approaching to the new supermarket at B
Section. There was a flag, an IFP flag, hanging, and I did not pay any
attention to that because I knew that different organisations would have
general meetings and rallies and marches. So that didn't bother me at
all. I went on ahead, I went to my house, and when I got home the first
thing I heard was that I should leave and - leave completely Mondlo, the
area. It wasn't as easy as that for me to leave the area because I had no
place to run to and to go to to seek refuge. Now, that group went to
section A, and there was an ANC office that had just been opened in
March. That was the office that we are going to support in campaigning.
We could not campaign with Vryheid branch, we had to campaign on our own
as uMondlo group. As I was home hardly 30 minutes I heard that the ANC
office had been destroyed by IFP members. We left with my brother, Moli,
who was the treasurer of the youth organisation, and tried to go and see
as to what happened and find out the details. We didn't have any weapons
with us at that time, we were just going there. The first thing we got
from the group that was running from A to B, section A to B, was that the
IFP group intended to kill every boy, and they alleged that they were
born of bitches. The first boy who was killed was found at a corner by a
super. They shoved the spears through. I am sorry, I don't know the name
of the boy.

	/He was

He was 14 years old. They carried on killing people at that time until we
met, the five of us. It was myself, Moli Mkwanazi, Vusi Khumalo, Victor
Mdlalose and Phumzile Dlamini. We gathered at some place next to the
office that we had just opened in uMondlo, started operating in. We saw a
police vehicle approaching with police inside. At that time the IFP group
was marching along the street heading to the church. When they got to us
they said they will only give us five minutes, and after five minutes had
lapsed we should disperse, and after that they will shoot. And they did
shoot, and we ran to Mseleku's building at the store. That's where we
hid. The police vehicle drove on ahead.

In that shooting did anyone sustain injuries? --- No. Then the IFP group
went back, making a U-turn by Lutheran Church. There was a funeral from
Bekkersdal, and the IFP member was to be buried in uMondlo. We had heard
that that was coming, and two buses arrived and had supporters of IFP
from Bekkersdal. What I will say is that those who were taking the
forefront in the whole thing were the members in uMondlo. IFP went back
to where the funeral was and took the casket and they went to bury their
member.

The one who was killed, how was he killed? --- Maybe I should go back and
say we had heard that a member of IFP who was shot in Bekkersdal,
residing at a hotel, will be buried. He was an IFP member, and I wouldn't
know the details of the shooting and so forth. And also we heard from the
people who would come and contact us that they were harassed at night,
Friday night. There was a shooting spree in uMondlo streets. The funeral
went on

	/ahead,

ahead, and after that, the IFP funeral, now they started calling us
names. The person who was in the forefront was Jerome Buthelezi. And one
other that I would like to disclose his name although I did not make
mention of his name in the statement is Nkomondo. I don't know his role
in the IFP, however the leaders of IFP then were Jerome Buthelezi and
Nkomondo. We did try to monitor the situation, and they went to bury and
they carried their member to the graveside, and they had with them
spears. And we tried to hide and keep a distance from them, about 900
metres away from them, and we were following them. There were those who
had black guns, and one had a sack full of guns, and there was a police
vehicle following them at the same time. Inside there was Mr Mdluli, the
assistant of Mondlo station commander. They were free and they went on
ahead and carried their member to the graveside. They stopped at Mondlo
in a gas station. That's where they started attacking us in public, and
others were happy about that action, IFP attacking us. The police were
watching and doing nothing to rescue us. After we had tried to run away
we got to the riverside and we found there was an ANC group still there
awaiting. We ran back and got to the post office, and we saw a police
vehicle, green in colour, and they started shooting at us for no apparent
reason. They never said a thing, but they started shooting. And we tried
another route. We ran through Inanda and we got section B. I am sorry, on
our way to B we saw a house that was burning. At A section when you pass
Super Garage there was a house whose owner was with them, their
supporter. We found out that the house that was being occupied by ANC
Comrades who were

	/destitute,

destitute, were the ANC members, and they did not have any place so they
had to go to Mondlo and occupy houses there as ANC members. And one other
member who was killed was Mike Mthethwa. We ran and we got to B section,
and in the afternoon we gathered as the youth of ANC and we headed to our
office, which was destroyed at the time, and we said, "Better still we
should be killed jointly like this," because we didn't know who was
behind this, whether ZP or IFP. Now we were chanting our songs and
singing our freedom songs and five vans came. I won't disclose one of the
police names, but there was a supervisor with them who said, "Let them be
shot." They started shooting indeed, and there was a van that was driving
behind me as I was running away, and they tried to shoot, and I was shot
right on my right hand - no, on my left hand, by these people in the van.
This is when I was shot as I was trying to escape, trying to jump the
fence, the wall fence. As I managed to jump I fell down on the other side
now.

I am sorry, Mr Buthelezi, is that the very night of the funeral, the very
day? --- Yes. During the day we were harassed, and in the evening this
took place and we decided to gather at some place.

There are incidents here that follow. Please be brief so we may listen to
the other incidents as well. Try to be brief. --- Maybe I should try.
From what IFP was doing at Mondlo in that time there were sergeants that
came to take statements about what was happening in uMondlo, and the City
Press members, who took statements. And they took all of that to the
Mondlo Police Station, but after that there were rumours that I was an
informer,

	/police

police informer. And one of the persons who was saying that, those
rumours, I know him, he's a police, and I know his name. The following
day on Monday I was standing by the office in uMondlo and the police
approached uMondlo, KwaZulu Police, and they were pointing guns at me and
said I should get into the car. And I asked them as to where they were
taking me to and they said I have with me a weapon, an axe, so I should
get into the car. Yes, I did get into the car and we went to Mondlo
Police Station. I asked the station commander, Mr Mxinga. Mr Mxinga did
come to me with Mr Ndlovu, and I asked them as to why I was arrested, why
were they arresting me. They said this was due to the axe that I had. I
asked Mr Mdluli that the previous day we were together monitoring the IFP
funeral, "And before you there were two boys who carried black guns, with
axes as well. Did you arrest those or did you bother yourself to ask them
as to why they had those things in their possession? But you did not.
However, you do find it easy to ask me. Is it because I am not an IFP?"
He did not respond. Shortly after that Mr Thompkin arrived, who was a
member of a police committee, and there was a meeting that convened as
well with the IFP followers, and ANC followers were present in the
meeting. And Mr Thompkin wanted to know why and what was the problem of
what was happening, but it was said that I have kept hostage of the IFP
members in the ANC office. And I repudiated all of that.

Let me disturb you and interpose right there. That was on the 21st of
March on Monday? --- Yes.

Now, what happened subsequently after your arrest and Mr Thompkin came?
What was the end of the whole

	/thing?

thing? --- They released me.

Now, take us to the next incident of the 24th of March where the
Stability Unit arrived. --- On the 24th of March we as ANC Youth had no
place to stay. We kept hearing news that somebody has died, the other has
died, and I was now staying at Dlamini's home in Mondlo. At about seven I
was outside. I saw a big green police vehicle, followed by a van, and
they parked in front of the house and the Stability Unit, the police, got
out and they were wearing copper hats. We could not see their faces,
their faces were covered. We were many in the yard, but we kept quiet and
we watched as to what was going to be done by the Stability Unit. They
asked for Bongani Buthelezi and they also asked for the guns. And I told
them I am the one, and there were no questions thereafter. Suddenly I was
assaulted, and they were using guns assaulting me, and I fell down and
four boys were taken. There at home we're quite numerous, and they took
four boys with me into the van, police van. And at the back there were
people in police uniforms, but they had covered their faces. I could not
tell who were they. And they had knives, Okapis, right inside the police
van. From the time it left my home it went to Hulyard(?) and they were
assaulting me, stabbing me. I was confused because I told myself that I
am with the police but all of this occurred still. And let me back-track,
let me also say something about when I was still at home. They asked for
weapons, guns, and also they asked for bombs. They searched the whole
house and the whole yard outside, but they could gain anything. And one
police came with a plastic full of petrol bombs and asked me as to who
those

	/petrol

petrol bombs were and belonged. I said I did not know, and we asked him
where did he get those bombs and he started assaulting us for asking
merely why and where were the bombs coming from. I was taken and they
alleged that the petrol bombs belonged to me. They took me into the van,
and that's when they were assaulting me, as they were assaulting me and
crying, shouting that, "You are hurting me," and they said - they gave me
some beer and they said I should use that as medication. And lo and
behold that was not beer, it was petrol. And I was still saying to them,
"I am hurt," and please they should leave me alone. And they kept - and
they were adamant, saying, "This is medication," and that was petrol that
they were giving me. They were using spears in the van, assaulting me.
The police said nothing to that effect. This is where they stabbed me.

Mr Buthelezi, you have suffered this ordeal, and what was the end? Did
they take you to the police station and did they lay any charges against
you? --- Yes, I was taken to the police station, and before any charges
were laid against me I was assaulted up until four in the morning. I
wasn't given any food, and I couldn't do anything, I was not functional.
I was assaulted and they made me drink petrol, and they insisted that I
should drink. I couldn't swallow that petrol, but they went on ahead
assaulting me. They told me I should ... (incomplete - end of Side B,
Tape 2) ... the ANC things, and the ANC recitations, or whatsoever. And
the following day I appeared in front of the Magistrate and I was taken
to the gaol, to the prison, and the case was postponed for the 18th of
the next month.

	/Mr Buthelezi,

Mr Buthelezi, I am left behind. When you went to appear in front of the
Magistrate what was the charge? --- They said I was found in possession
of bombs and - well, 11 explosions.

Is that the case that went on to the 18th of July 1995, and ended by the
fact that there was not enough evidence? --- Yes, that's the one.

According to your statement you also tell us about the threatening calls
that you will be killed. Now tell us precisely about that. --- Yes, after
I had seen the Magistrate I was sent to prison. The following day I got
the telephone call, and the person was anonymous and told me that if I
don't change my mind and join IFP I will be killed. Well, fine, I did not
pay any attention then. I went to the head of the prison and reported
that to him. And I told him that I receive a call at nine, and if I did
not receive any call at nine I will receive the call at night. And I will
be told to join the IFP, if I don't I will be killed. On Sunday of that
week I got a telephone call from my auntie and I was told that my house
was set alight and burnt down. I don't know why that was done.

How long were you Ganders Bend(?)? --- I was there since March and April,
and was released on the 27th of May. After being - I was released on
bail. I had no place to stay, and I knew that I had a home in Mondlo. I
went to Vryheid to the Comrades that I won't disclose their names.

Even now you are still with your Comrades? --- No.

Are you back at home at Mondlo? --- No. On that evening I tried to go to
Mondlo because I wanted to see

	/what

what was happening. I had no clothes. The only clothes I had were the
ones I had in prison. I tried my best to go home. When I got off the
taxi, tried to go around the school, I met two people who were
approaching me from the opposite direction. The third one I met was
headed to the same direction, and I was standing by smoking. And they go
to different directions, and the other one suddenly shot, and I tried to
run and I went to - I tried to rescue myself by crawling along the river,
trying to go to section A. And there was a police by the name of Fanta,
who was known as Fanta. I didn't know the police in person, but I had
heard that there's a police by the name of Fanta.

Sorry, excuse us. Please give us the surname of Fanta because we had a
problem, we wanted to send Fanta the notice, but we couldn't. --- He is
Constable Malinga. When Constable Malinga, known as Fanta, shot,
according to you did he intend to kill you, or he was simply threatening
you? --- He intended to kill me. If I did not try to retreat I would have
been killed.

Let me go back to those who assaulted you? --- Where is Constable
Malinga, Fanta? --- Since I left Mondlo that day I had never seen him. I
do hear that he is around, but I haven't seen him.

And the next person I would like to touch here is - or I wanted to know
about Constable Malinga, I wasn't clear about him. One other thing I
would like to ask, did you lay any charges against - with regards to this
torture and harassment by the police in the van? --- I did try, but I was
told that they could not do anything in as far as that was concerned.
There was no place I could

	/open

open this case, because when I was arrested I was already under
oppression of ZP. And also I heard that ZP was against me and they
intended killing me. Now, when I was - when I left I went to Mondlo ...
(inaudible) ... graveyard. That's where I slept that evening. There were
two of us who tried to go to Mondlo. The following day in the morning I
found out that Vusi Khumalo was shot, and the bullet was extracted
however at the hospital.

Where is Vusi Khumalo? --- He is here in Vryheid.

Do you know if he has submitted any statement to the Commission? --- Yes,
I do hope that he submitted a statement to the Commission.

Mr Buthelezi, let me thank you before I hand you over to the Chairlady.
We've heard your grievances, and also that you are destitute, and also
that you want that Constable Malinga should be investigated, and the
treatment he gave you. We will try our best to follow just that. With
regard to your home or place to stay, we don't really have the
prerogative. The only prerogative we have is that we will compile a
recommendation and a report for the President, and the President will
look into the Commission's report, and how people were tortured and
harassed and their requests, and he will thereafter see what shall be
done, and your recommendation as well will be forwarded to the President.
The President will respond to all of these matters. And also about your
view of uMondlo Police Station, that it should be newly managed or
organised in a better way. That we will pay attention to. And one thing I
would like to compliment about you. According to your statement you do
say that in spite of

	/all this

all this you still don't hate anyone, and you don't hold any grudges
against anyone, and you are prepared to forgive everyone who comes to
you. That we appreciate a great deal because only a few people think that
way. After all the ordeal that you have gone through you are still
prepared to shake hands and talk to people and look at things positively.
I will now hand you over to the Chairlady.

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Buthelezi, you said that there were people that alleged
you are an informer. Do you know those people? --- Briefly I will say -
although I am not certain about this I will say one of them who said that
in a group, and I heard him - I know him, I won't disclose his name.

Now, that's what I wanted to hear. We've heard your story, and it's not
different from all other stories we've heard, especially what the youth
went through during those years. We just thank you for being such a hero,
together with those who were working with you, your colleagues so to
speak, to stand up for the truth even after all what you went through and
the ordeal you've suffered. One other thing that I appreciate in your
statement is where you say although you were harassed you don't have a
place to stay right now, you are destitute, and you once was a civilian
or a citizen in uMondlo, but you are prepared to reconcile and tie the
past with the present, and you hope for the best, that things will get
better and so on. It's good to have hope because hope keeps one going. We
thank you in that regard.

About the other statements you wanted to refer to, we will gladly tell
you that there are statement-takers

	/that you

that you could contact, and we will emphasise that you see the
statement-takers and lay your story as well. Thank you.

	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: The next witness who will come forward to the witness stand
is Jabulani Buthelezi. We will afford him an opportunity to render his
testimony. Good morning, Jabulani Buthelezi. You are with somebody there.
Would you tell us her name.

MR BUTHELEZI: This is my sister. I am with my sister.

CHAIRPERSON: Will she say something or she is simply accompanying you?

MR BUTHELEZI: Yes, she will like to say something, a word or two.

CHAIRPERSON: Did she submit any statement at all?

MR BUTHELEZI: Yes, she has submitted a statement.

CHAIRPERSON: What's your name?

MS BUTHELEZI: My name is Monica. Monica is my name.

CHAIRPERSON: According to our procedure and programme you are not
anywhere in our list. However, you will sit right next to Jabulani and
give him moral support. At this point we'll kindly ask Jabulani to stand
up and raise his right hand so he can take the oath

	---------------------

JABULANI BUTHELEZI (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: You are here about your story and what happened to you. You
have two children. Is Nthobeko at school or what? --- Yes, Nthobeko is at
school and she is in standard six.

What about Lindiwe? --- Yes, Lindiwe is at school as well and doing her
first year.

Do you still have a wife? --- Yes, I do.

What about the parents, do you have your parents still? --- Yes, I do.

How many are you in your family? We mean your

	/mother's

mother's children. --- We are five. There is five of us.

Are you all working? --- No, I am not working.

Who is not working? --- I am not working.

Oh, you are the one who isn't working. --- And also my younger brother
isn't working. My younger brother isn't working.

You are here about an incident that took place in 1994. Would you kindly
relate to this Commission as to what happened and what was happening at
that point in time? --- In 1994 it was on the 20th April, it was in the
morning around seven, I saw my neighbours. I was at the neighbour's
house. I saw a group of people approaching, and my ... (intervention)

What is the bride's name? --- It's Thembi. Oh, my wife is Thembi Gloria.
She is also here.

What is Gloria's surname? --- Her surname is Ndlovu. She woke me and I
woke up, and I saw the school children running and I went to the door to
see as to what was happening. I realised that those were not school
children, they were elderly people, and the neighbours said, "We don't
know what will happen to those that we leave behind. We are heading
forward and we are going to fight and we are going to the battle." I was
surprised, and especially I didn't know - I was in the dark, I didn't
know what was happening. I didn't know whether it was a fight, a battle,
or what. I went to ask as to what was happening and tried to inquire. I
thought probably they were running after some animal, or perhaps they
were running after a thief. I went to inquire as to what was happening,
and some said, "Come here. Come here, we will

	/tell you."

tell you." Some said this, and the other said some other things, and they
all had weapons. I didn't have one. I asked as to why they were calling
me to join them because I wasn't armed. They were divided. Some went
across the river and others now they tried - they were now forming a
circle of some kind. I tried to move back and they started right away
hitting me, assaulting me, using the traditional weapons, the knobkerries
as well. I tried to run as fast as my feet could carry me. I saw the
other group of people approaching suddenly. They were attracted by what
was happening there. The other group from the other side had guns, and
the other group of the other side said they were not fighting, but there
were only two people that were after this. I don't know if I should say
this or disclose this, especially the names. I don't think I am safe if I
do that.

Do you know their names? --- Yes, I know their names. And some could be
present here, and I am afraid, I don't think it's ideal for me to
disclose of any names.

Well, if you are not free to disclose the names just tell the lady who is
sitting right next to you, but not now, the names. --- Right then I tried
to go to the house, and I managed to do that, and there was - now the
place had turned into a battlefield. People were running to and fro, and
even in the house where I was people had left. It was myself and my wife
and the rest had gone. We did not even know which direction to head to
because the place had turned some kind of turmoil. I saw the house was
burning, my house was burning, and I wasn't too sure whether my parents
were in the house as the house was burning. It was set alight, we don't
know by who. And my

	/father-in-law

father-in-law said to me, "Well, let's do trust and hope that everything
is fine. Though the house was burning perhaps your parents are safe." The
following day I met my cousin and my cousin tried to console me and told
me that my aunt and my father were safe, they were not affected at all by
what happened. Then that consoled me a great deal. And still the battle
was going on even to date. I never took part, especially that I did not
know what was happening or what was the gist of the matter. I will say
this. I went to the ANC. Somebody said to me, "He is the one who started
the fight," and that disturbed me a lot because I now was destitute, I
had no place to stay, no clothes, and I had lost my beloved ones. I am
not the one who started the fight. Somebody else did that, and was
telling the community that, "He started the fight," and I know the person
who started the fight, and he was counted as one behind this whole thing.
I can't mention his name.

Can you mention it? --- I can't disclose any names. I don't think that
will be ideal thing to do. After that I don't know what happened for I
didn't see what happened. According to your statement you make mention of
Nquthu Hospital, you went to the hospital. --- Yes, I did go to Nquthu
Hospital, and still I did not see those who assaulted me. I was hurt
here. I sustained injuries on my forehead. I was bleeding profusely
through my mouth, and even here on my forehead I sustained fatal
injuries. My jaws as well sustained injuries.

Who did you see in the hospital? Do you have any records from the
hospital? --- Yes.

	/What

What about the Nquthu Hospital? Tell us is it Charles Dot Memorial
Hospital, or what? --- Oh, those are two different hospitals.

Explain which hospital you went to? --- It's Johanson(?).

Can you explain precisely about the issue between ANC and Inkatha? What
was happening at the time, because you say you did not know as to what
was happening? What was the essence of the whole thing? --- I wouldn't
say there wasn't anything happening, because I know that ANC was doing
its own things and playing around with its flag. And I couldn't
understand as to whether the fight was on or what was happening. I was
lost.

Did you lay any charges? --- No, I did not lay any charges.

Explain to the Commission about your injuries. How do you feel now? How
do you fare? --- Since then I am not as healthy as I used to be. I can't
lift heavy things any more.

You mean you can't use both your hands to lift up heavy stuff, or one?
--- I can't lift, especially using my right hand. And when it's hot in
the day my sight is not good. And I do get dizzy spells at the same time.

You have made mention of Gloria Ndlovu. You told us that Gloria Ndlovu is
a wife. Whose wife is Gloria Ndlovu? --- She is my wife.

Do you think there were people who witnessed this incident? --- I may ask
Gloria Ndlovu because she witnessed all this, especially that she is here.

No, we cannot let that happen. Only you have taken

	/the oath,

the oath, and only you can render any testimony and say anything even
though Gloria has seen that. But we will also ask you if there were any
other people who saw this? --- That much I wouldn't know because I had
lost consciousness. I did not see many things that happened, only
afterwards, so I wouldn't know who else witnessed that.

Would you put your request forward to the Commission? What would you like
this Commission to do for you? --- I would appreciate anything that the
Commission could do for you.

Give us the full names of the witness, the one who -Gloria, we referred
to Gloria - her full names. --- She is Thembilihle.

You mean that's your wife, isn't it? --- Yes. 	She is the one who
witnessed this incident. --- Yes.

Was she with you during that time? --- Yes, she was with me.

Is there anything that you will want to say? --- No, I think that is it.

MR LAX: Thank you, Chairperson. Just two short questions please. I am not
clear if I wasn't listening properly, but I heard you say that you had
lost your loved ones, you had lost your house. Which loved ones did you
lose? --- What I said was that many lost their houses and their loved
ones, and that hurt me afterwards when I discovered that there was
someone who was behind that.

You haven't explained to us how this violence actually started, and in
your statement you've said that somebody had spread a rumour that the IFP
were going to

	/attack,

attack, and that therefore in response to that rumour the

ANC counter-attacked first. --- Yes, there was something like that. These
two people will get to the IFP and leave the IFP, go to the IFP and say,
"The ANC had said this. They will come today," and leave the IFP and go
back to the ANC and say, "The IFP is going to attack, is coming to
attack. Run away." So there was that kind of thing going on.

Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Jabulani, we thank you for taking this opportunity of coming
in front of this Commission. As we have listened to your story it goes to
show that that was the time when there was confusion in the area,
especially in the community, as you have explicitly explained that there
were people who were trying to get the two groups to fight. And we will
not even know whether those people were members of ANC or IFP, but they
were strongly behind this confusion. And you have sustained injuries, and
for no apparent reason because you did not even know what was happening.
But it goes to show that we are coming from a terrible time, and you have
mentioned that there are names that you won't disclose, and we don't want
to put you in that difficult situation. However, we have our own way of
investigating, and we will find out those names, and if need be we will
get in touch with them. As for your injuries and as for your health,
there is nothing much that we may promise you now, but there is little
that we could offer you, maybe like seeing if you could be taken to
hospital in one way or the other, especially that your hands have been
strongly affected, you can't lose them and lift any heavy things. You
would need to see the

	/physiotherapist

physiotherapist at the hospital. And also you get dizzy

things that we will attend to, and the lady sitting right next to you
will help you. And there are people that we will leave behind that we
hope will look into such issues and matters and see how they will enlist
help to people like you. And we do thank the fact that your parents
survived this. Thank you.

	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: (Incomplete) ... Chief Elphas Molefe. We greet you, Chief
Molefe. Would you prefer that you speak Sotho or Sesotho?

	---------------------

ELPHAS MOLEFE (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Lax will be the one who is leading you into your evidence.

MR LAX: Thank you, Chairperson. Good afternoon, Chief Molefe. --- Thank
you.

You have very kindly given us the details of your relatives and your
family, including your wife's details, and I won't - in the interests of
not taking up too much time I won't go over them again. One aspect we
haven't covered are just your brothers and sisters. How many are still
alive? --- I have two sisters and I have one brother.

Now, the story that you're going to tell us about involves the area that
you were chief of in the Nquthu district, and started in 1988. It is
quite a long and detailed story, and I will ask you to try and be as
brief as possible but without leaving essential details. Please continue.

INTERPRETER: We will request the channel to be tuned in, channel four,
for the witness.

MR LAX: Okay, just one second please. Can you just make sure that your
headphones are on channel four please. Can you hear properly now? ---
Yes, I can hear you.

Maybe I can help you just by dealing with some of the early details. When
did you become chief of the Molefe tribe? --- From 1967 I have been the
chief of the Molefe tribe.

	/And that

And that was after your father passed away. --- Yes, that is correct.

And these troubles started in 1988. --- Yes, that is so.

Just tell us how they commenced. Sorry, there seems to be a problem with
the Zulu not coming through on the main system. (Pause) Sorry, can the
audience hear the Zulu, or is it quiet?

CHAIRPERSON: We will ask the witness to render his testimony in Zulu.

MR LAX: What we'll do is we'll just start again, and I will just confirm
that you became chief of Molefe tribe in 1967 after the death of your
late father. These problems started in 1988 with the killing of your son,
Sechaba Thobang Molefe --- That is correct.

Please will you continue and explain what happened and how it was that
your son came to be killed. --- There were problems here in KwaZulu-Natal
a long time. These problems started long before 1988. These problems
started in 1967, but the real problems started in 1988. That's where I am
going to start. Early in the morning I was woked up by a friend of my son
from Nquthu at Mkonjani area. When he woked me up he told me that my son
was killed at Nquthu, and he was killed by a policeman between the Nquthu
Hospital and Mkhize Hotel, and these policemen were two. One of them I
didn't mention on my statement, but he is a policeman from Vryheid and I
am not willing to reveal his name at this moment. They shot my son. We
went to hospital in the morning. We started in hospital and then we went
on to the police station, and that's where we found his body. His corpse
was in the

	/mortuary

mortuary so we couldn't speak to him. What was said to me was that I had
already depended on this boy of mine. I wanted to take him to university
because he was my eldest son and he was my heir.

Chief, you mentioned that one of the policemen came from Vryheid. Where
was the other policeman from? --- The other one was from Nquthu Police
Station. His name is on the statement, B B Gunene.

Please continue. --- The post-mortem was conducted, and the result was
that - I was still a chief at that time. The Government didn't come to me
and talk to me as a chief after the policeman has done this. Even the
Minister of the Police in KwaZulu-Natal didn't bother to come and talk to
me concerning this issue. It was just over like that. That's when I
realised that they killed my son because they suspected that he was an
ANC or rather a UDF member.

Was there ever an inquest into your son's death? --- There was never any
inquest. We were called though to come to court and the case was heard
over three days, and then for the fourth time I didn't appear to court
and I didn't know what was the decision of the Court, and I still don't
know who was found guilty or who wasn't found guilty.

Which court was ... (inaudible) --- Nquthu Court.

Do you remember more or less the year that happened in? --- It was in
1988. It went on until 1989.

Thank you. Please continue. The next aspect of your statement refers to
your suspension and removal as chief, which happened in September 1989.
--- In

	/September

September 1989 I received a letter from the Government, KwaZulu
Government, and I was told that I am supposed to leave my job. I was no
longer a chief, I mustn't touch anything. I stopped working. On the 29th
of November the very same year, in 1989, I went to see the lawyers, CLC
lawyers or attorneys. We went to the court in Durban. I was never called
to go on the witness stand. They kept on remanding the case, and my
attorneys told me that the reason they are remanding my case it's because
there is no investigation with regard to suspension as a chief. And then
they referred the case back to Madadeni. In Madadeni they told me that
the Magistrate - or the Magistrate from Madadeni told me that the
decision will be taken at Ulundi. After that Ulundi never told me
anything as to what decision they came to. I also asked my attorneys what
was the decision. I was never told.

(Inaudible) ... understand you, you are unsure as to precisely why you've
been suspended and what the status of that suspension is. --- That is
correct. In 1992 I received a letter saying that I am being dismissed as
a Molefe chief.

Is that the letter you gave us dated 15th of June 1992? --- That is
correct, that's the very same letter.

Just for the record it's a letter signed by Dr Buthelezi as Chief
Minister of KwaZulu. --- That is correct.

(Inaudible) ... in terms of the relevant legislation giving him power to
do that. --- That is correct.

And since that time your appeal hasn't been followed through or anything
of that nature? --- After my

	/appeal

appeal my family went to Ulundi and they tried to find out what was going
on, and they were told that they will be told. Again my tribe went to
Ulundi. They also gave them the same answer, that they will respond to
them, they will write a letter. Councillors and indunas also went to
Ulundi. Myself I went to Ulundi. I went to see Mr Nyanga Ngubane. I went
there myself because I wanted to found out how long I am going to stay
like this on suspension, and he also told me they will write a letter to
me. And also Mr Ngubane never responded up until today.

Has anyone been appointed yet as chief in your place? --- No one has been
appointed from 1989 to rule the Molefe tribe, and that's actually a
problem because there is no tribe which can stay for seven years without
a chief. Their grievances are not met. They can't go to anyone to ask for
things like building roads, building schools, or whenever people are
quarrelling to resolve those conflicts. People need a chief to do all
these things, or to try to. The Molefe tribe doesn't have someone like
that. They are still having a problem.

(Inaudible) ... move on next to the events that happened in November
1993, where your house was attacked, and if you can just give us a
background to how that attack happened, what was going on at that time,
and so on. --- It was on the 7th, 1993, November. Six men came and they
approached to my gate. As they were entering the gate they surrounded my
house. They didn't even greet anyone and then they started shooting. As
they were shooting 10 - 14 kids were killed. Some of them died instantly
and some of them died in hospital. These kids were supposed to go to a
rally at Nquthu, and it was an

	/ANC rally.

ANC rally. It was on the 7th of November. ANC people sent a message to
these kids that they mustn't go to a rally because they've heard that
they were going to be attacked if they go to a rally. Therefore these
kids listened and they didn't go. So other youths from other places came
to my place to collect my sons as well. Sepho was one of my sons. And
then they stayed in my house, and when I came to my house I was from
another house of mine. As I was trying to undress myself - I was in my
bedroom - I heard gunfire outside. I would like to explain this to the
Commission. As I am talking to you I am very grateful to come here and
talk to you, because today might be my last day alive, because I also
don't know how I escaped all these attacks. Kids surrounded my body. They
grabbed me, they pushed me under the bed, they slept all on the bed
because they didn't want me to get killed. And these people kept on
firing guns. Because God was there with us, even though I was shot. Even
though the boys tried to protect me I was shot on my left leg - or hand,
and also on my right leg, under my feet. My shoes got off my feet.

(Inaudible) ... you mentioned a figure of 14 people that died, or let's
say it was translated as 14. There appeared to be some hesitation in it.
I just want to be clear. Exactly how many people died in that attack? If
you're not sure just tell us you're not sure. --- 11.

11 people. And approximately six people were injured in that incident.
--- That is correct.

And amongst those that died was your son, Sepho. --- That is correct.

Now, the next main incident that happened was in April 1994. It was round
about the time of the elections. 	/--- During

--- During the elections I was in hospital. People from my house or back
home reported to me that people have died at Xaladu. People had been
shot. Who belonged to the IFP organisation were shot. Only five survived.
And Chief Molefe also was shot.

Was this Alfred Molefe? --- Yes, this was Alfred Molefe.

(Inaudible) --- Yes, he was one of the chiefs - induna.

(Inaudible) ... in your statement that there were police involved in that
shooting. --- That's very true. The ANC Comrades at Xaladu did say that
the police were there present and shooting, and ZP. Even though they did
not disclose the names, but that's the report I received.

The next incident you talk about was in July 1995, and then subsequent
incidents in March 1996. As a result of all these incidents your house
was destroyed, and the material stolen, and other things stolen, is that
right? --- That is correct.

The reason I am going quickly over these things is they happened outside
the time of our mandate. Our Commission's mandate stops in May 1994, but
I am just mentioning this because these are things that are part of a
continuing sequence of events. Now, in that attack in March Sibusiso
Ndlovu was killed at your house. --- He was killed outside in the house
while he was trying to escape. He was shot and burned and died on the
spot.

This violence that has taken place at your area, would you characterise
it as violence as a result of conflict between the ANC and the IFP? ---
This

	/violence

violence that erupted it's due to the fact that IFP dislike the presence
of the ANC in the area. Even some of the IFP members do insist that if
you are an ANC you are not allowed to walk around in the area.

At present you are not staying in the area. --- Yes, that's correct, I am
not at my place. I reside here in Vryheid, and I am only renting a house.
I move from one place to another with my children. I don't have a stable
place where I reside.

Why don't you reside back in your area? --- I can't go back to my area to
reside there because there are many occasions where attempted attacks
took place, and if I insist to go there I may even lose my life. I will
not for any reason go back there. It's hard for me to do. Also for the
sake of the children, you want to consider that. And they have been
psychologically affected as well, and I attribute all of this to the
attacks.

(Inaudible) ... return to the Chairperson.

CHAIRPERSON: We have heard, Chief Molefe, about the ordeal you have
suffered. I hear you putting emphasis on the children, about the fact
that you are destitute, you move from one place to another, you don't
have a place to stay. What I what I would like to know is that are your
children schooling? --- Yes, many of them are. The majority of my
children are still at school. One is enrolled for marketing and computer
... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 4) ... in Vryheid. And I want to
tell the Commission that I won't disclose the place where they are here
in Vryheid. They are at school though. And I don't have sufficient funds.
I just get there and there, money from there and there, to put my
children to school.

	/Don't you

Don't you think your children are psychologically affected in one way or
the other? --- Chairlady, some of my children have been traumatised,
because this other one loses memory from one time to another.

Who is that one? --- It's Simo, Simo Mugalasa.

Is that the surname or the name? --- The name.

In what standard is she? --- He. He is in standard three. The other one
is Thabelo.

What about Thabelo? Is she fine? --- No, she has a problem. She is not
doing well at school. She keeps failing each standard, and also now he is
above age.

We have heard your story, Mr Molefe. It's painful to realise that there
is no respect in the community, and again what befell you, anyone could
be the victim of the same fate that befell you in this community, as you
have lost your two sons on top of the rest that happened to you. And one
other aspect that's painful is the fact that we keep on hearing the fact
that police were present and could not provide any security or safety for
you. And some other times we do hear that police took part in these
incidents. But we do trust and hope, and we have this hope, that in the
future the situation will get better, and an effort is being put to
reconcile and tie the past with the future. What we'll advise you about
is that we will compile a report here as the Commission and forward it,
as the other statements that will be forwarded to the President, and the
President will see that people like you receive attention. It looks like
the children have suffered this ordeal, and we would advise you to get in
touch with the counsellors present here and see if the children won't
receive any psychological help. Perhaps

	/all this

all this - we could attribute all of this suffering to what you suffered.
We do trust and hope that you'll be safe, and we thank you.

	---------------------

CHAIRPERSON: Please, we are about to adjourn. May we be seated and let
there be order in the hall. This disturbs us. We have just found out that
amongst the children that were injured in this incident that Chief Molefe
has just related it's that the parents of those children are present
here, and we will request the parents of the children who were injured in
this incident to stand up so we may see them. The parents of the children
that were injured in this incident the chief has just related. You may be
seated. We realise that you are hurt inside, and we await the time when
your wounds will be healed. And we know that as the chief was relating
you were taken back in time when all this happened, and also we'd like to
thank you now for coming here, knowing very well that your story is part
and parcel of what the chief has related, and you were still brave enough
to be here and listen to the chief, and also give the chief the moral
support which he needed the most as he rendered his testimony. We do
believe that the Lord will be by your side and the wounds will be healed
in no time, and we trust that even you will be able - or will plan to
meet the counsellors, the Truth Commission counsellors that we'll also
leave here in Vryheid. We do believe that you will be helped by getting
in touch with them, and God will bless you.

Before we adjourn for lunch we have a few announcements here. On the 12th
May, next month - we refer to next month - in Mondlo location we will be
having

	/statement-

statement-takers who will be taking statements. We do request you that
you send the word around so that people may prepare to go to Mondlo at
10.00 am to submit their statements. On the following day, on the 13th of
May, the statements will be taken in Vryheid at the same time, that is
10.00 am. On the 12th it will be at Mondlo, and on the 13th May it will
be here in Vryheid at 10.00 am. Now, the venues, the locations rather
where the statements will be taken, will be announced in due time through
the Radio Zulu. Now, please pay attention to every detail from Radio Zulu
so you may know when and where especially the statements will be taken.
We do request that you send the word around and people get to know about
this, even those who did attend, because we need to hear your views and
your versions of the story.

We will adjourn for lunch now. It is 1 o'clock. We'll just have a short
adjournment for lunch because our day - we are running behind time. We
will be back here at half past one and continue with the programme of the
day. Thank you.

LUNCH ADJOURNMENT

	ON RESUMPTION:

ON RESUMPTION:

CHAIRPERSON: (Incomplete) ... to each and every one of you. We'll carry
on with our programme. We will be listening to Albert Mhande Nsibande. He
is already seated on the witness stand. Good afternoon. You are here to
relate about the murder and the shooting of Mr Mcetywa and yourself. We
will ask you to stand up to take the oath.

	---------------------

ALBERT MHANDE NSIBANDE (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: The Commissioner who will lead you will be Mr Mdu Dlamini.

MR DLAMINI: Good afternoon, Albert. --- Good afternoon to you.

How are you feeling, how are you faring? Are you okay? --- I am not fine.

You have already given us the names of the children, Ndisi Mkwanazi. How
old is Ndisi? Just a rough estimation. How old is Ndisi? --- Four to six
years, just a rough estimation.

Don't you worry. I know men always have problems in knowing the ages of
the children. Thanks for that estimation. What about Lindiwe Ngcube, her
estimation? --- I think Lindiwe is six, around the same age.

What about Sepelele Ngcube? --- Sepelele is seven years old.

And Siyabonga? (Pause) I know men are like that. Don't you worry, I know
that. --- Yes.

About the parents, do you still have your parents? --- I have one left
and it's my mother.

How is your mother, how is she faring? --- Well,

	/she is

she is struggling. She is not fairly well because she was injured on her
leg.

What about your father, is he late? --- Yes, he is deceased.

Was he sick or he died from an attack or violence? --- No, he was sick
and died.

Are you married? --- No.

What about the children, do they live with you or with their mother? ---
I gave two to my sister, and the other two are with the mother.

Mr Nsibande, the story you are going to relate to the Commission is the
incident that took place when you were going to - while awaiting the
funeral of Mcetywa, who was the leader, and - the leader of ANC in
Pongola. Mrs Mcetywa has already given us a clear picture with regard to
the structure of ANC and its beginning in your area, and the duties and
work of Mr Mcetywa up to the time when he was killed. I will therefore
ask you - I know you would have loved to give us the whole story, but
give us an abridged version, and start from November 1993 when you were
at a night vigil when you were injured. --- On that day when we had the
night vigil, a night before the funeral of Comrade Mcetywa, during the
day of that day I was sitting under the tree alone watching, waiting for
the right time to go to the night vigil. A car passed by, a three-litre
Ford Sierra passed by, and I saw the people who were inside the car, as
to who they were.

The people you saw are the ones you have in your statement, Police Nyuni
Nyango and Police Maseka, and Gribond, who is a police? Gribond, is this
a nickname or the real name? --- No, we used to call him Gribond. I think
that's his real name. I don't know his surname,

	/but that's

but that's the name.

Would you be able to find out the surname after some time? --- Yes,
because the girlfriend is somewhere nearby in the neighbourhood.

We will ask you to kindly find out the surname. We'll probably get back
in touch with you telephonically. 	The registration of this car, what was
it? --- If I am not mistaken it's ... (incomplete)

INTERPRETER: The interpreter could not catch that. The interpreter is
asking for the witness to be audible. --- NO 1336, that was the car
registration used by the ZP. 1336 car registration used by the ZP.

MR DLAMINI: Yes, I did interpose right there. Now, you saw that car and
the people in the car. Now carry on. --- After that I went back home and
took a shower and prepared myself to go. And I left, I met with other
colleagues, and we went to Comrade Mcetywa's place. I think it was about
half past eight when I said to one boy, "Hey, boy, let's get outside and
just sit out there and chill and smoke." Yes, we did smoke, and it was
beginning to be dark, and we saw the very same car. It came by still,
coming to A section, and it take a U-turn under the light and I said to
the boy, to Mfana, "We are not safe outside here. Maybe we have to get
right inside the yard for protection." Indeed we crossed the street and
went inside the premises, the yard. As we were approaching the house we
heard that sound.

INTERPRETER: The interpreter could not get that.

MR DLAMINI: The interpreter could not get that. Please clarify what that
is. --- I don't know. Oh, those are the guns that they carry with. That's
how we got shot.

	/And I

And I heard the sound of the gunshot and we lied down instantly so we
could retreat, and that's how now I got shot as I tried to crawl to the
safe place. They were able to see us because they were in the dark and we
were right in the light. I fell, and remembered and thought that the
person could see me, maybe I should just try crawl as fast as I could to
hide away. And I managed to hide away, and I tried to call the others and
warn them of the situation that was prevailing. And at the time they were
trying to show how many of us were injured.

Where were you injured? --- I sustained injuries on my right leg, up of
the thigh, and at the hospital I was operated on the left side, appendix
I think. And I could not go to the toilet and had no appetite at all.
However, gradually I managed to get back. My heart was torn apart,
because each time I looked at this operation I felt like crying.

Were you at Ngwelezana Hospital? --- Yes, I was there.

And according to our records you were there almost one full year. --- Yes.

Do you still have the hospital records with you? --- Yes, I have IP
numbers of the Ngwelezana file, the hospital file. I have them at home.

Do you have them with you right there or they are at home? --- No, they
are at home, I don't have them with me.

We'll make means to get those files so we can get in touch with the
hospital personnel to gather full information and be furnished with all
the details. Right now I have seen that you are not walking properly.
Where

	/else

else have you been injured? --- This is the leg that was fatally injured,
and I could not even show my parent how brutal the wound is, because I
know that after that she won't cope with that, my parent won't cope with
that. To date I am suffering from that wound of the gunshot. Even
psychologically when I think - you know, there are times when I sit alone
and think, and I will cry, I will cry bitterly.

We'll wait for the witness to regain composure. Take your time, Mr
Nsibande. (Pause) You were still explaining how the wound is, and you are
even sceptical of showing it to your parent. And we are aware that even
psychologically, even mentally, you are highly affected, that there are
things you cannot carry on with now. And have you been in touch with the
doctors or something? --- I think I am not a male any more. I can't have
children since the attack.

Maybe you should contact the - did you ever think of contacting the
doctors in this regard? --- I don't have money to pay the doctors.

Even the pension is not sufficient? --- I am not getting any pension fund
even now.

One other thing. Maybe have you tried to receive psychological help to
face the situation that you are faced with at the time? --- No, I did not
receive any such help.

Would you appreciate such help? --- Yes.

There are people who will talk to you after this, and open up to them and
do make mention of the fact that you need psychological help. And I think
also you need to get the doctor's view with the fact that you are now

	/unable

unable to have children. The doctors will give you their views in that
perspective. How many people were injured on that day? --- We were eight.

What about the other seven, how is their condition? Did they go to the
hospital? --- We were all taken to the hospital.	

How are they faring now? --- Some are better, and there is this one
other, Xolani, the bullet penetrated through his knee and it was never
extracted, and to date his knee is not functional. And there was one who
was shot from the back, from behind, and I think he is much better now
because he even drives his car. And the girl that was with us - we were
seven, and we had a girl with us, and was shot right on her feet. Others
were shot in such a way that they were able to receive preliminary
medical attention, and they responded to that quite well. I was the worst
because I was in the hospital for a long time.

Would you perhaps know if the others did submit the statements to the
Commission? --- Thetelele, who was one of us, did submit his statement,
and we submitted our statements at the same time.

Thank you. Did you lay any charges? --- It wasn't as easy, because when
we were taken to Ngwelezana it was as a result of the police. One of the
sergeants, SAP sergeants, said - and he wasn't aware that I was there -
that he was saying, "We are looking for them. We went to Nongoma, we went
to the hospital because we wanted to kill them right inside the
hospital." That was the sergeant saying that, the SAP, and he was not
aware that I am around. We could not lay any charges due to that,

	/because

because the police station commander was collaborating with the Inkatha
people and the ZP.

The police in the car, the car that was shooting, where are they, the
police that shot from the car? --- One of them I just heard that he is a
sergeant in the Stability Unit.

Who is that? --- That is Nyuni Nyango.

Where is Nyango located, in which police station? --- I don't know.

But you just heard that he is with the Stability Unit? What about Maseka?
--- I wouldn't know where -well, he is located in KwaKeza.

What about Gribond? --- Gribond has been since deceased.

What killed him? --- That much I wouldn't know and wouldn't explain,
because he collapsed in front of the office where he was working from and
that was it.

As you were injured were you able to work, and where were you working?
--- I was working at one building contract.

What is the name? --- It's WJ Construction.

Did they give you any compensation as a result of your injuries? --- No.

Did you get any green card? --- Nothing.

Where is this construction office based? Do you have the work records?
What about the pay slip? Do you have any? --- No, I don't.

What were you, were you a part-time worker, or were you a full-time? ---
No, I was a part-time worker. I was working temporarily.

How long did you work there? --- I worked there

	/for five

for five months.

Mr Nsibande, we do empathise with you, with what you went through,
especially what you were facing, with a future to face on top of that.
There are requests that you've made mention of in your statement, some of
which we've already addressed. As we have said to others, likewise we
will say it to you, that your requests will be compiled in a report and
be forwarded right to the Cabinet and the President of the country. We
will recommend on your behalf as to what will be helpful to you, and we
want to assure you as well that a report will be compiled and be
forwarded to the Cabinet and the State President, and it is their
prerogative to see what to do after that. And the other things that we've
already addressed, like your psychological problems, to contact the
doctors, and the like, we will pay attention to that with immediate
effect. Thank you very much. But don't leave yet, the Chairlady has a
word or two too.

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Nsibande, I think I heard you saying you have children
with your sister and some with their mother. Did I hear you right? ---
There are two with my sister, and the other two are with their respective
mothers.

Now, you don't have any child with you? --- No, I would not afford to
support any child at this stage.

We have heard in the morning when Mrs Mcetywa rendered her testimony with
regard to what happened in your area at this given time. We are sorry and
sad that when you did not even intend to do any harm, but only supporting
what happened, and subsequent to that you found yourself in this ordeal.
It is sad that that happened to

	/you, and

you, and especially it shows that our very own people, I mean police, did
take part, and they are our hope. Now that they fight against us it's a
wonder. However, we thank you because you were heroes in one way or the
other, and you stood very firm on what you believed so that everyone
could benefit in the country. Mr Dlamini has already made mention of the
fact that - as for your recommendations will be compiled, and a report
will be forwarded to the State President, and he will see how you should
be helped. What I would like to know is that as you are still attending,
going to see the doctor at the hospital, what happens? --- No, I do wish
to go to the hospital so they may extract the iron inside that was
inserted in me. And it's been time since I have seen the doctor.

But it is imperative that you see the doctor, are you aware? --- Yes. I
don't have money. Money is the centre of my problem.

Don't you have hospitals around? --- Yes, there are hospitals, but I will
prefer to go to the hospital that I first went to. In that way they have
the history of my injuries and stuff.

Maybe it will be necessary for you to say everything to the counsellors,
our counsellors, so they may advise you better, because it is dangerous
for you not to see any doctor or receive any medical attention at this
stage. You have to receive medical attention in whatever way. On top of
that I would like to thank you for coming to the commission and disclose
of your story. Thank you.

	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: Our next witness who will be afforded opportunity to relate
his story will be Andreas Mphani Sithole. We greet you, Mr Sithole. You
came here to relate to us about your story of how your house was burnt.
Before you start relating your testimony to us we would like you to stand
up and raise your right hand.

	---------------------

ANDREAS MPHANI SITHOLE (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: We will ask Mr Dlamini to lead you in giving your testimony.

MR DLAMINI: I greet you, Mr Sithole. Mr Sithole, according to our records
you are staying in Haladu in Nquthu. --- Yes, that's where I was staying,
but I am no longer staying there.

Where are you staying now? --- I am now staying at eMadwaleni.

I would like to rectify that area. Do you have a house at Madaleni or
you're renting a place? --- No, I am still renting.

Where is eMadwaleni? Is it at Nquthu? --- No, it's at Nqeni, next to
Mdlalose's area.

Another thing, Mr Sithole, you didn't give us information about your
family background. Do you still have your wife? --- Yes, she is still
alive. I have two wives.

Are they around today? --- No, they aren't here, they are at home.

How many children? --- I have four children.

How old are they? Are they still young? --- Yes, all four of them are
still minors. In fact my kids -they are actually my grandchildren. Only
one is mine. I

	/have

have three children, but they are already on their own dependent.

Are they working? --- One is working, the other one is not working.

And the third one? --- The third one is just getting babies at home. She
is not working.

Mr Sithole, you are here because you want to relate to us as to how your
house was burnt. This incident occurred in 1994. --- Yes, that's correct.

Would you please tell us what happened before? --- I don't know what
happened, but there was a conflict between ANC and Inkatha, and then I
ran away.

When you ran away is there anything that happened to cause this running
away? Were you attacked first before you ran away, or you heard of a
meeting for another organisation? Were there other people attacking other
people? What happened? --- I can't tell because I ran away. The situation
was so bad that I just ran away.

What happened, what caused this running away? --- We saw a group of
people coming and they were shooting at each other, and then we ran away.

Were these people ANC people? --- I think so, but I am not sure.

Were they coming to your area, and your area is predominantly IFP area?
--- Yes, that is correct.

The conflict between ANC and IFP in your area is caused by what? --- No,
I can't tell that. I don't k now what actually causes this conflict.

I am asking this because we've discovered that in 1994 at Haladu the
situation was terrible bad. People lost their stock, and some people lost
their lives.

	/That's

That's why I wanted you here today to tell us what happened, or how can
we solve these problems. --- I don't know. I don't know how we can solve
this and I don't know what causes this.

When you ran away with your children and your wife were there people who
got injured in your family? --- No, no one. Everyone was safe, because my
family ran away first and I followed afterwards, not knowing where they
ran to.

Your stocks? --- No, I didn't lose any of my stock. I took it with me.
Only my houses were burnt, but my stock was safe.

Did you report this matter to the police? --- Yes, I did.

Which police station did you report this matter? --- I went to Espicon,
next to Mondlo, and then I went to Nquthu, because the police from
Espicon Police Station couldn't help me. Then the police from Nquthu were
the ones who helped me to gather whatever was remaining behind.

Did they give you your case number? --- No, they didn't.

I am asking this because our investigators went to Mondlo Police Station
to gather the records as to what actions they've taken after this
incident, and they found that in their records there was no evidence as
to whether you did come to them and report the matter. --- No, they
didn't give me any case number.

Mr Sithole, I would like to know if you are here because you want the
Commission to ask something on your behalf with regard to what you've
lost. --- Yes. I

	/would

would like the Commission to help me with regard to the damages I've
suffered.

You mean your houses which were burnt? --- Yes, I would like the
Commission to please rebuild those houses for me.

Did you manage to remove the goods inside your house? --- No, we didn't,
because we were running away. We just ran.

Mr Sithole, this is very sad. According to our records you are 68 years,
and someone who is as old as you to run away and not knowing what caused
the violence, and I would like to express our sympathy to you, and I
trust that you will be helped in somehow. As we have said to others that
we are going to take all these statements and we are going to make
recommendations to the President, and what I would like to tell you is
that it will take time because everyone will be given a chance to come
forward and ask for whatever he or she wants to ask. So it won't be
something that will occur today or tomorrow, it will take time, like
maybe next year. Don't stand up because the Chairlady will have a word
with you.

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Sithole, I am not quite sure whether I didn't hear this
one correct. Are you receiving any pension? --- Yes, I do.

From these two wives of yours is there any of them who is getting
pension? --- Yes, they are receiving pension.

It is very sad that the situation we've been through in our country
didn't choose. It happened to many people. At your age it's nice and it
feels good to know that when you look back you know you've worked all
your life and

	/this is

this is what you've worked for. It's very sad that someone at your age
will look back and realise that he had lost everything he worked for when
he was still young, and worse when you realise that these things have
been taken away from you by people, just people who didn't really care
about life or human life. You didn't even expect or anticipated that
these things will happen to you. Maybe we can hope that our grandchildren
won't experience what we've experienced. As you've heard my colleague
telling you that we will make recommendations to the President, even
though it will take time. Right now what we have, or what we can offer,
is we do have our counsellors and psychologists who can help you. Thank
you.

	/CHAIRPERSON:

CHAIRPERSON: Good afternoon, Mr ... (inaudible) ... you have come to this
Commission with regard to the shooting that took place and you were shot.
Before you relate your story to the Commission we would kindly ask you to
stand up, raise your right hand in preparation of taking the oath. And I
also would like to thank you for the opportunity that you came to the
Commission to relate your story.

	---------------------

SOLOMON TSHAKALA (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Lax will be the one who will be helping you in relating
your evidence.

MR LAX: (Inaudible) ... can you hear me now? --- Yes, I do.

Sorry, once again I just - good afternoon to you. We have had the details
of your family with which you've kindly provided us. One aspect that
wasn't covered was your parents. Are your parents still with us? --- No,
they aren't.

Now, you are from the Highlands area in Pongola, is that correct? ---
That is correct.

And you're going to tell us about the incident where you were shot. ---
Yes, that's correct.

In 1989. I beg your pardon, 1991. --- That is correct.

Before we get to that incident, you mention in your statement that there
was a dispute between two different chiefs in your area. --- That is
correct.

Who were those chiefs? --- Chief Hlangamanza and Chief Ntshangase.

What was the dispute about? --- It was about the 	/area.

area.

(Inaudible) ... the area? --- Hlangamanza was the one who said to Chief
Ntshangase he was owning his area.

How did this dispute develop further? --- In 1988 - it started from 1988
to 1989. There was a dispute, and it led to court. And after the hearing
of this dispute in court in 1989 there was peace. It so happened that
people were relaxed, but they were not so relaxed because some people
lost family members. There was peace though, even though people couldn't
see eye to eye. It so happened that in 1991 in January my child came from
Johannesburg. His name was Busanangu. I left home at about 11 o'clock,
accompanying him to the station - bus stop. As we were heading towards
the bus stop he boarded a taxi - or a bus. I returned back home. After my
son had boarded the bus, as I was heading home, a certain car came
belonging to Mr Ngwenya. There were five of them inside that car, and
then I told myself, "Oh, there's a car," and I realised that it was Mr
Ngwenya's car. He got off from his car and he opened the door for these
four other people who were also inside the car. And then Mr Ngwenya said
to me, "Ntshangase, here are these people," and I got confused and then I
approached them. As I was approaching them one guy pointed a gun at me.
He was from behind that car. And then I was still surprised and they
started firing. One bullet shot got into my hand and the other one into
my jaw. And Mr Ngwenya was now inside his car, at the back of his car. He
knew all these people and he knew their mission. A second man came from
the front of the car. He shot at me. And then I kept on

	/approaching

approaching them, and I held an umbrella in my hand. And then they shot
at Mr Ngwenya's car. Four bullets got into Mr Ngwenya's car. And then
this guy chased them away, and they got into a kombi and then they drove
off. And Mr Ngwenya took us to hospital. I didn't know these people. I
didn't know them at all. In hospital they referred me to Ngwelezana
Hospital because the doctors from the first hospital said they couldn't
help me. So also in Ngwelezana they referred me to King Edward. I was
admitted there for two months. They stitched my jaws. I couldn't eat. I
was drinking amahewu. I got better and I was discharged, I went back
home. I arrived home on Monday. When I got home - on Wednesday I was
supposed to go back to King Edward - I heard that Mr Ngwenya had been
killed. He had been shot dead. I went back to hospital. I was treated and
they told me I should come for check ups. I went back home. Police came
to my house, and they had names of the people who shot at me. They told
me that "The people who shot you were Jabulani Manana, Elliot Mkwanazi."
And then I asked the police what was the reason. The police told me, "We
don't know." We went to court, to Piet Retief Court, and the case was
remanded. It was still in 1991. I think it was somewhere in May. The case
was remanded to the 5th of June. We went back. After the 5th of May I got
back home and there was no one who came back to me to explain, and I saw
a policeman who took the statement from me. I asked the police, "What
happened? How come I am not hearing anything about this case?" The police
told me, "I was in Soweto." I asked the police, "If you are in Soweto you
took all the papers or the statements with you?" The police said, "No, I
left

	/them with

them with other police." So I asked the police, "How come because there
was no one who came back to me and told me as to when the case was going
to be heard?" And later I learnt that the case had been heard and I
wasn't supposed to be told about it. And there were lawyers there, and
then I wanted to found out as to what was going to happen to me. I
couldn't get any assistance and I was delayed that I came before the
Commission today. I think I've got a chance. Maybe you can help me with
this regard.

There are just some aspects I'd like to follow up. You - I am just
concerned that I am not calling you by the right name. You mentioned that
they spoke to you as Ntshangase. Is that your surname, or is that
somebody else who was with you? --- Ntshangase is my son, the one I was
accompanying to the bus stop.

Now, there were other people that were accompanying you. --- Those are
the people who were in Mr Ngwenya's car. They were all going to the same
area where I was going.

You mentioned the name Simon Ntshangase, Amos Ntshangase, Mapuzweni
Ntshangase. --- Those are the people I was with.

(Inaudible) ... people who got out of the car and were talking to you
when these people approached? --- Yes, those are the people we were shot
with.

(Inaudible) --- Yes, with me.

(Inaudible) ... Amos Ntshangase was also shot, and that he later died of
his injuries. --- Two of them died, Amos Ntshangase and Ngwenya. Those
two died.

Now, was Ngwenya shot at that time or at a later time? --- Later time,
after I left hospital.

	/Okay.

Okay. Now, do you know anything about the people that shot you, what
their motivation might have been? --- No, I don't have any idea. That's
what I need to understand. I need to know what I have done. I still need
to resolve this thing with these people.

Somewhere in your statement you mention that it was suspected that these
people thought you might be ANC supporters. --- No, that's not correct.

(Inaudible) ... misunderstanding? --- Yes, that was a misunderstanding.

(Inaudible) ... that you were IFP members at that time. --- That is
correct, I was an IFP member.

Was there political violence going on in your area at that time? That is
in 1991. --- Yes, there was political violence, but one couldn't explain
because ANC had no grudges with any other organisation, even Inkatha as
well. But there was no violence as such as to killing people.

So you don't really know why these people shot you? --- No, I don't know.

I didn't hear very clearly the place where the court case was. --- Piet
Retief.

And you've given us some dates which will help us trace the case. Now,
which police station did you go to? Oh, here it is here - Mahamba Police
Station. --- I went to Mahamba. I gave them my statement.

You said it was Sergeant Hlope that handled the case. --- That is correct.

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Tshakala, we've heard your story and we would like to
take this opportunity to thank you for coming here. It is very disturbing
to know or to realise

	/that

that many people have suffered in those days, yet they didn't know why
they were suffering so much. This is reflecting to us how difficult it
was for us in those days. I trust that as you came here before the
Commission you will find a little bit of relief, and we're going to take
this statement and we're going to make recommendations to the President.
He's the one who will know what to do. We do have counsellors, and we
would like you to get into contact with them, and you must tell them
everything, every need, every grievances that you have, something that
will help you in this situation. Thank you.

GRETA MTHETHWA (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Lax will lead you.

MR LAX: Good afternoon, Mrs Mthethwa. Welcome again. --- I greet you also.

We've got the details of your family, and from this we can see that you
have a son and three grandchildren. --- Others are grown up now.

(Inaudible) ... just for the record can you tell us who the other
children are that you haven't mentioned here. You mentioned ...
(inaudible) ... I assume, or some other grandchildren. --- I am Sizagele.

Are you Sizagele? --- Yes.

Okay. You've mentioned Thelemuza. --- That is my son.

(Inaudible) --- Clarisse, Xolani, Windi, Sifiso.

(Inaudible) --- Yes, that's it.

(Inaudible) --- Yes.

Now, your troubles seem to have started in the Nquthu district when your
late husband joined Contralesa. --- Not my late husband. I have my
husband. He's alive.

(Inaudible) ... very confusing. Sorry. I apologise. --- What happened is
this is my second husband. He joined Contralesa. My first husband died.

Okay. Thanks for clearing up the confusion. Please continue with the
story and just tell us what happened

	/from 1985.

from 1985. --- My husband joined Contralesa, and then after he had joined
Contralesa ... (incomplete)

Please continue. --- After he had joined Contralesa - Contralesa was
pro-ANC - pro-Democratic Party in the area, and it was not favoured in
Nquthu. People were very against Contralesa, and ... (inaudible)

Sorry, the - it's okay if you can speak in Zulu, that's also all right.
You don't have to speak in English. --- I can speak in ... (inaudible)

Please continue. --- All right. And then there was ... (inaudible)

It may be helpful if you ... (incomplete)

INTERPRETER: What is happening here? Yes, all right, go on ahead in Zulu.
I'll interpret. --- I would like to say that my husband joined Contralesa
with Chief Molefe, Elphas Molefe of Nquthu. When he joined Contralesa
that's where things began, when we got to be enemies in Nquthu. I tried
my level best to show him and advise him of my background since I was an
IFP member, and once was a member of Legislative Assembly, Inkatha
Legislative. I withdrew my membership from IFP and stopped politics
altogether before I got married to Mthethwa. Mthethwa himself joined
Contralesa, and I pleaded with him not to join Contralesa because I knew
very well what Inkatha and its members are. I know them very well. I was
in the centre of IFP in the central committee. But he wouldn't listen to
me. Things went on and now boycotts started, and I got married, and we
had businesses that belonged to myself and my husband, and there were
boycotts.

CHAIRPERSON: Tell us what kind of business? --- It was a supermarket, a
restaurant, and a filling station as

	/well.

well. And the fried chicken outlet. And there was a book shop and the
butchery.

MR LAX: Please take your time. Take your time. (Pause) --- My boys from
my first marriage were still very young then, and it was easy for people
to say they were ANC boys, and they weren't. I never was a member of ANC
even at once. I am a child of God, I am a brethren. At night I couldn't
sleep peacefully because I had heard threats from people that my husband
was in danger. In 1987 - I am sorry, in 1988 he left for Lusaka to meet
ANC. That was before the ANC was unbanned, and he met the members of ANC
and he was with the people of Contralesa. And when he got back that was
known, and I was told that it was not acceptable what my husband was
doing and into. I got a number of threats at work. It was in 1989. I was
so scared. And in 1990 people boycotted, and I could see danger facing my
children. I told my husband, and I was adamant, saying, "I know IFP very
well. Please withdraw." He nevertheless went on, and I could see that my
stay and everything wasn't safe. I therefore decided to sell some of my
businesses and we flee. We left for Johannesburg, and my boys were
attending high school. When I got to Johannesburg we bought a house in a
boer suburb, and the boers came and stole money, close to R1 million,
because at the time the boers were very racist and could not accept any
black person living around their suburbs. We got back. I left my husband
in Johannesburg and decided to go back to Nquthu, and I deemed it fit for
him to just remain and I will leave and go back. Although I withdrew from
Inkatha I have nothing against them, and they are no things that I do
behind Inkatha's back, so I will go back

	/to Nquthu.

to Nquthu.

In 1991 you moved back to Nquthu. --- That is correct. There were some
other properties that I never sold, and I used the supermarket, the small
supermarket. It was no longer a big supermarket. And the fried chicken
outlet and the filling station, as well as the restaurant where people
will sit and dine in Nquthu, that's what was left. It went on. Please
forgive me in case I make a mistake here. There were papers that were
distributed in Nquthu that Winnie Mandela and Peter Mokaba will come and
address in Nquthu, you know the prominent figures of ANC. I said to
myself, "Oh my goodness, if my husband sees these papers Inkatha will
kill me." He was the one arranging for the arrival of Winnie Mandela and
Peter Mokaba, and it was bad, the situation was bad then. Some did not
believe that I am not an ANC member. We were sort of harassed. People
will come around to my house, and at the same time I wasn't at peace. I
was forever alert of any situation that was happening, awaiting for my
husband's return. There was this incident when Kizwe shot at Molefe's and
11 of them were shot. On that very day when Molefe's child was shot I was
going to church in the morning. When we were approaching the corner next
to Nquthu Hospital I saw the fellow church members. I do believe that God
Almighty overcomes everything. I said to myself, "Well, they should join
us, these other fellow members, church members." We gave them a ride to
church, and in front there was a kombi awaiting to shoot at us, a yellow
kombi, and the boy who was going to shoot at us was standing right
outside the kombi. I left, pleading with my husband not to get off the
car. Maybe I should drive

	/the vehicle

the vehicle because they wouldn't shoot me. We went to church that day,
on that day that Molefe's children were killed, the 11 boys were shot. My
husband took part in the preparation of the funeral. That's what
reinforced the whole thing, and I could see that I will never have a
peaceful stay here. From then I took my children with, because they will
come for holidays, and went to Dundee. That's where I bought a house. No,
I rented a house from an Indian man. I occupied that house, suffering of
course, tremendously so. In 1994 - I went to Dundee in 1993 with my
children, struggling, trying to hide every time, praying to God Almighty
to protect us and keep us on His might hand. One time in the morning we
went to church. We found out people are waiting for us along the
roadside. And one time I told my husband not to go to church, I will go
to church, and he said he wouldn't afford not to go to church. I pleaded
with him that there are ANC members at the stadium together with one man
who was Harry Gwala as well. I told him not to go to church but to go to
the stadium. On that very day when I got to church at 12, when my husband
had to preach, I preached on his behalf. And I saw the brethren looking
back at the door, and the kombi came full of the boys with guns, ready to
shoot at us. And I pleaded with the church members that we should pray,
and I thanked God because they gave up, they never shot us. On that day I
found those boys who were intending to shoot us with Chief Ngobese. They
were standing with Chief Ngobese talking to him. Chief Ngobese - I had
nothing against Chief Ngobese, but he had a problem with my husband and
as a result of that that affected my relationship with him as well.

	/Just

Just before you continue, there was something you mentioned in your
statement which you've left out here, and that was about an attack on
your house in 1993 after a big meeting at Nquthu. --- Oh yes, I remember
that. I omitted that. Yes, there was a meeting and was addressed by
Gideon Zulu. After that people ran to the store, and we tried to close
the store but they were forcing to gain entry into the store, and that's
when I realised how great God is, because they threw eight bombs right
inside the store and not even one blasted. They took money, they filled
their vehicles with petrol for free of charge, and I refused my husband
to come to Nquthu. But as a man he would insist and be adamant that he
will do what he wants to do. On that day the meeting was Nqabenyeni - the
meeting. Those who attended said there was a child who said there are
people who have just arrived. Gideon Zulu said that, and people ran and
flee from the hall to the store in an attempt to kill us, but thanks God
because they never managed.

(Inaudible) ... you living back in Nquthu now? --- Yes, but what I would
like to say now is that they took my possessions, they took petrol, and
they also took the goods as well, and I have nothing today. I am
suffering. Even coming here I had to get ride from people. I have lost
entirely everything. I was black-listed in the community, and I am
black-listed as well. I can't do anything. Today Nquthu is back on its
feet, but I am still suffering the ordeal. But thank God that not even
one died in my family. I don't even know how that happened. That's a
miracle. We went to Dundee and opened a shop. They threw bombs in the
other store but nothing

	/happened.

happened. When I got to Dundee I opened a shop. That's where they will
come, the police I mean, using ZP1271, looking for my husband, intending
to shoot my husband right in the store. I will stand and look at them
timidly, and they will surround my husband intending to shoot him. I
reported it in every aspect of this matter to the police. I tried even to
get the workers, the employees, to report their own version to the police
station, but to no avail. One day when I was in Dundee on the 29th of
December 1993, it was about three in the afternoon, I received a call
from the ladies in the shop, the employees. The IFP people attacked us
and wanted us to get out of the store, but Khoza came in to our rescue.
He is the one who came to our rescue. He was with Buthelezi. I left, I
went to the store, and I saw that the store was closed already. I prayed,
didn't know what to do, and I pleaded with them to go back to work as
well. They refused, and all ended on that note. I would try my best to
sell so I could be able to support my family and pay my rent in Dundee,
but to no avail.

(Inaudible) ... laid charges many many times with the police, and is it
correct that nothing's ever happened? --- Nothing ever happened,
completely nothing. And I owe many people because I had some loans from
different people, and I borrowed some goods from other people, but I
could not pay them - and companies as well.

(Inaudible) ... hand back to the Chairperson.

CHAIRPERSON: Greta, we've heard your story. There's just one thing I
would like to ask according to your statement. I am not too sure if it's
right that after

	/you've

you've laid the charges in Nquthu the damage was worth R50 000,00 or R5
000,00. What is the right amount? --- You mean the windows, the damage?
No, I refer to my door. My door was a glass door and it was worth R5
000,00. And over and above that I had written down each and every damage,
because they would try and break the till to reach and get money, but
they failed however. Fortunately they did not kill anyone.

Where do your children go to school? --- They have stopped. Some were at
Westville, University of Westville. My boy was at St Martin's. They had
to stop schooling.

Now what are they doing? --- They did not complete their studies because
I was in debts myself. They had to leave school.

One other last thing I would like to put to you and ask. The one person
you talk about that you were together in Boksburg, what is his name? ---
His name is Andy Smith.

What happened to the CC with Andy Smith that you formed? --- Andy Smith
tried to commit suicide and he disappeared subsequently.

There are times when one wouldn't know what to say, especially to people
who have suffered such great ordeals. It is clear to everyone that you
have worked so hard, but all that took just a minute to get destructed.
We do trust and hope that we will get to the time in the future where
things will work out better than in the past. I see you are a woman of
faith, and I have listened to you. Often times than not you keep
mentioning God. That tells me a lot about your faith, and it goes without
doubt that

	/you are

you are a woman of faith. Do you suffer emotionally due to this? --- Yes,
but God helped me. I suffered from high blood pressure. I was admitted at
Newcastle. I also had sinusitis problem and I was drained in 1994
November, and again in 1995 November I was drained for sinusitis problem.
I had tremendous stress due to the fact that I had lost all my
possessions - cars, you name it. I have worked so hard as a nurse in 19 -
I quite my job in 1969, and I was still young then, single still. I
acquired all of this not easy. I passed my BA and UEd degrees and tried
the businesses, and I was a successful entrepreneur up until the time
when all this transpired, and as a result of that I am suffering.

But have you gotten in touch with the psychologists? --- I did psychiatry
myself at school. You know, I think there are times when I just helped
myself and decided no, I think I am insane now, and I have to help myself
since I did psychiatry at school as well.

You know in Zulu we have this thing that - the saying that the doctor
cannot heal himself. Perhaps it will be wise and advisable for you to get
in touch with the psychologists. We even hope that the boys that are not
at school right now will one day reach their goals and go as far as you
have gone academically. --- I was hurt and I accused the boers so much
that today I forgive them, because I was also forgiven. I lost so much
due to the treatment of the boers. I am looking at the Government today.
When we were at Dundee all the boys who were running from ANC from
different areas will come to my husband, and each time I think of telling
them to go back to their houses I will think of their mothers, parents,

	/what

what will they say? Now we would try our best to accommodate them. Some
will be hurt brutally by Inkatha. We would try to accommodate and give
them warmth. I went through ANC to enlist help, but I got nothing. I
don't even know whether he is better than de Klerk. I mean Mandela. But
what I will say is that as a Christian I do trust and hope that you know
that some other things take time. God takes His own time, and the fact
that people don't think the same, and also don't forget that the
pressures you suffer are the pressures other people suffer as well.

It's a good thing that you are such a forgiving lady, and in whatever
that we do we shall consider forgiving, even forgiving our very black
people, fellow blacks, not only the boers. We are trying to reconcile the
country. Please be patient, and perseverance pays as well, because one
day you will knock at the door and the door will be opened. ---
Chairlady, I am forever in the run, running from the sheriff. Can ...

MRS MOLEFE: I am Makemiso.

CHAIRPERSON: Are you the one who is going to testify here today?

MRS MOLEFE: Yes.

CHAIRPERSON: Who is the lady accompanying you?

MRS MOLEFE: She is my daughter-in-law. I brought her here so that she can
remind me as well, because I am old and other things have happened a long
time ago and I can't remember everything. Like, for instance, I am having
a problem remembering dates, months.

CHAIRPERSON: It's okay if she is just going to remind you. I would like
you to stand up so that you take an oath. We would like to know the name
of the lady next to you, or rather your daughter-in-law.

MR DLAMINI: What is your name?

MRS MOLEFE: Lydia Molefe.

CHAIRPERSON: Are you the daughter-in-law to Mrs Molefe? Because now you
are going to assist Mrs Molefe we would request you to stand up and take
an oath.

	---------------------

MAKEMISO MOLEFE and LYDIA MOLEFE (Sworn, State)

CHAIRPERSON: The person who will lead you whilst giving evidence will be
Mr Mdu Dlamini. --- We greet you, Mr Dlamini.

MR DLAMINI: (Inaudible) ... share with us today two tragic incidents. One
relates to your son who was killed in Johannesburg in 1993. --- That is
correct.

As if that was not enough the other one relates to your husband, who was
also killed in 1994. --- That is correct.

	/(Inaudible)

(Inaudible) ... by confirming the family details as I have them on my
record. You have told us that you have got three children - Richard, you
son, who is 24 years of age. --- That is correct.

What does Richard do? --- He is at school.

(Inaudible) ... doing? --- He is in standard six.

The next one is Wilbur, who is 16 years of age. --- That is correct. He
is still at school. He is currently doing standard five.

(Inaudible) ... your daughter, Suzetta, who is 13 years of age. --- That
is correct. She is in standard six.

And the deceased, did he have his - I mean your son who died, did he have
family of his own? --- He didn't have a family of his own. He was not yet
married then.

(Inaudible) --- That is correct.

(Inaudible) ... not have children outside marriage? --- He didn't have
children. He does not have children. He was a worker then. He worked at
Germiston.

(Inaudible) ... because I would prefer that I lead you by questions,
especially in his case, because there is crucial information that we
need. Before his death was he a member of any organisation? --- He was in
Germiston. He boarded a train, then ... (intervention)

Mama, I know you would like to tell us that story, but it's important
that I get this information correct. Was he a member of any organisation?
--- He was not a member of any organisation, or political organisation.

(Inaudible) ... political organisation? --- He was an ANC member.

	/Are you

Are you sure that he was an ANC member? --- Yes, because his father was
also an ANC member.

And he died - he was killed in Johannesburg. --- He was killed in
Johannesburg at Thokoza location. His corpse was found by Mr Nthanzi's
chauffeur. Mr Nthanzi's chauffeur reported that there's a child who died
there in Thokoza.

I missed the name of the person who found the corpse. --- He is from
Gauteng, but his name is Nthanzi.

(Inaudible) ... your son was staying as a tenant. --- Yes, that's the
person I am referring to.

Do you have contact details of Mr Nthanzi? --- Are you referring to Mr
Nthanzi? He stays at Moutong section.

(Inaudible) ... or telephone? --- Are you referring to his address?

Or the telephone number. --- Are you referring to the address at Moutong
section?

INTERPRETER: If you could raise your voice please so that the
interpreters could hear you. --- No 4587 Moutong Section. It is in
Katlehong Location. 1832, I think that is the code.

MR DLAMINI: (Inaudible) --- Yes, I do. 909-2290.

I am surprised. You said earlier on that you are a forgetful lady, but
you can remember everything. Did you get the death certificate in respect
of Siphiwe, your son? --- Yes, I did receive the death certificate of my
son -my husband.

(Inaudible) ... records. If it is available you can just give it to us
afterwards. --- I do have the

	/certificate

certificate with me.

We'll get it from you afterwards. --- I want to request through you that
I relate my husband's story.

(Inaudible) ... as I said that the reason for mentioning that it's very
important that I get it. I'll definitely give you a chance, I promise.
You earlier on mentioned that your son was employed. --- That is correct.

Did you get any benefits from his employers? --- I didn't receive
anything from his employers.

Do you have the name and the contact address of the employers? --- No, we
didn't receive anything from them.

Thank you. We tried to investigate the death of your son. The problem
that we encountered is that we did not know exactly where the death took
place. Subsequently ... (intervention) --- At Ekosini(?) where they shot
him. Ekosini section, I believe it's Ekosini section, in Katlehong. He
was on board the train to Ekosini from Germiston.

Were there any eye witnesses? --- They saw him only in the morning.

You don't have any other information that could help our investigators to
find out the people who killed your son? --- I don't have it, Sir.

(Inaudible) ... ask that if you get any information at any stage please
let us know, because we would like to investigate the death of your son.
--- I will do so.

Now I'll move over to your husband. According to our records your husband
was a member of the ANC. --- That is correct.

	/At the

At the time of his death he was 72 years of age. --- That is correct.

(Inaudible) ... reported that one relative, close relative to yourself,
attempted to recruit your husband to join IFP. --- That is correct.
However, he joined the ANC.

Yes, we are aware of that, that he decided to join the ANC. Can I now
allow you to tell us how your husband was killed? --- He was going
towards the mountain to a function there. Then he also decided to go
there to seek refuge, but however Inkatha was heading towards the
mountain on the other side. He didn't observe that. They attacked him and
stoned him, and then stabbed him with a spear. He fell down. That was it.
I could not see because I was at hospital by then. I heard this from the
children, who told me that my husband was stabbed by a spear that killed
him. At the hospital they came to my place. They took our livestock,
cows, and the furniture in the house. They broke the windows. They burned
everything and took almost everything that we had in the house. We didn't
even have anything to bury him in. Even the cows were taken. I was left
desolate. I even asked a blanket to wrap him with from Agrippa Molefe's
family. Beforehand his brother, Jomo, arrived at home. I thought he was
going to assist, but I said to him let us go carrying our identity
documents together down there. However, I didn't know what his intentions
were. When he was killed by Inkatha it was because he refused to go there
because Job wanted to seek assistance for him. I am referring to my
husband. He didn't go there. Maybe he could be alive by now. Inkatha was
from the direction of

	/Nkande,

Nkande, then he was proved to go there to get assistance. He refused and
took his own way.

(Inaudible) ... a little bit. What assistance was that? --- I am
referring to what led to my husband's death. This man intended to assist
him trying to shield him from this attack. "Come and bring your identity
document and join Inkatha so that you can survive." However, my husband
refused. I was at hospital. I had suffered from sugar diabetes at that
time. We slept in the veld, or rather at the mountain. We stay at Haladu.

(Inaudible) --- Yes, we did go back to our original home.

(Inaudible) ... our investigators in contact with the local police
station. --- They didn't contact us because there was not good relations
between police and the community. We could only see police Casspirs and
soldiers. This was not discussed with anyone.

(Inaudible) ... and I am sure I did not come across clearly. What I was
trying to say is that the investigators from the TRC, after having
received your statement, have been to the local police station to find
out the progress on the investigation, or the inquiry about the death of
your husband. As a result of ... (intervention) --- There was no
correspondence with regards to that.

Yes, I know. That's what I am trying to tell her, that this is what we
have done from the TRC from the time she gave us her statement. We have
managed to get a copy of the inquest finding and other documents
technically known as J56. I promise that we will keep you informed of our
investigations and findings. --- I thank you.

	/We have

We have also noted the loss in the form of 10 heads of cattle, household
contents, and of course the irrecoverable loss or your husband and your
son. --- Yes, that is correct.

Mama, we have also noted your expectations, the things that you would
like the TRC to do for you, and we have noted that your late son,
Siphiwe, was the main breadwinner of the family. We really appreciate the
predicament that you are in as a result of the two deaths. As I said to
other witnesses before you that all these requests will be conveyed to
the State President, and we hope that he will be able - together with his
Cabinet he will be able to do something to show solidarity and support to
you people. --- We are grateful for that.

As I said that we'll keep you informed, is there anything, additional
information regarding the death of your son or your husband, that we
think we must know which is going to help us with our investigations? ---
I have no knowledge with regards to those two matters.

Thank you very much for the information you have given us, and also thank
you for the time. As I promised that we will keep you informed of the
developments. Can I hand you over to the Chairperson now.

CHAIRPERSON: Mrs Makemiso, are you working? --- I am not working. I am a
labourer. I work on my small gardens. However, since I have lost my
cattle I have got nothing that I live from. At the moment there's nothing
that I am doing.

Are you presently receiving pension from the State? --- Yes, I do.

We have listened to your story. Chief Molefe was

	/also

also present, he presented his story to us. It is very problematic that
during times that we live in we meet incidents like this. However, we
believe that as time goes on most of the things will be stable in this
new South Africa. As I have said previously, your story will also be
included in the report that will be forwarded to the State President, and
assistance that might be recommended by the President will come from him.
However, you can consult the counsellors that we have here. They will try
to assist you where they can. We thank you. --- I am grateful.

DINAH MBUTHU (Sworn, States)

CHAIRPERSON: Mr Lax will be the one who will be helping you in giving
your evidence.

MR LAX: (Inaudible) --- Good afternoon to you, Sir.

Just for the record, you have come to tell us the story of your son. ---
That's very true.

(Inaudible) ... in-law could not be here this afternoon. --- That's true.

And you have actually made a statement to the Commission already. ---
That is correct.

Now, could you just help us please with some details of your family? Is
it correct that your son had six children? --- That is correct, he had
six children.

Thandi, Sizwe, Thokozani, Siphiwe, Mlungisi and Zakele. --- That's Zanele.

(Inaudible) ... must have made a spelling mistake here. What are their
approximate ages? --- I wouldn't know their ages because the first-born
had just completed his standard 10. That is Sizwe, and the girl is still
- could not complete as she suffered the death of her father. These
others, the four, are at school, those who come after Sizwe and Thandi.
Thokozani is at school. Siphiwe and Mlungisi are at school. Zanele is not
yet at school.

(Inaudible) ... for us. Now, you're here to tell us

	/about

about the death of your son. --- Correct.

Which happened on the 14th of April 1994. --- That is correct.

Please go ahead. --- We were at Haladu. In that year I wasn't feeling
well, I was ill, and swollen the whole body, and the children were out in
the fields with the livestock. When they got back they talked about the
battle and the fight, that when it gets here we will be the first victim,
the Mbuthu family. Those were the neighbour's children. And I did not pay
much attention to that. Late in the afternoon, as I was lying down sick,
I saw the neighbours running. No, they came to my house to ask for
refuge, and they were telling me there's a fight, and a fight coming in
and going on. I could not function very well as I was sick, and in the
morning still there was nothing, there was no fight, no battle at all.
They went back to their respective homes, and the next time around they
came again. You see as neighbours we know one another, and we are in good
terms. They are my children as well. The neighbour's children are mine as
well, and we are a praying home and we will pray together with these
children. Nothing was funny about this.

Just one second, if I can interrupt you there please. What is the name of
your neighbours? What is the family name of those people? --- It's Khanya
family who used to come and sleep at my house, running away from the
fight.

Please continue. --- One day - I have my boy, who was born in 1970, and
had impregnated a girl in the neighbourhood, and I asked for the child,
the grandchild, and he had to pay damages for that. They brought the
child who is a grandchild and we saw fire and we saw smoke

	/right

right down the road, and we were surprised what was happening. And that
day we had this function of accepting my daughter-in-law. We saw many
neighbours and children running to my house. I asked, "What's happening?"
They said, "There is a fight that's just erupted on the other side."
People were sweating, running for their lives, and they alleged that the
people were coming from eMondlo, and my son was forever in town, where he
was selling, perhaps a vendor. He was a vendor here in town. And I asked
him, "What are you going to be selling?" He said, "I will be selling
meat," and I said to him, "No, only women sell meat, not men." As this
went on he wasn't there. He had two children with a certain girl, and at
times he could not come back to my house and would spend time with the
other lady who has two children with him. And the situation was not
stable at that time. We will see people running to and fro and claiming
that there is a fight erupting.

(Inaudible) ... interrupt you again. You speak a lot about fighting. What
was the fighting about? --- May you repeat your question.

You've told us about a number of instances where people were fighting
with one another, some people running away, some people attacking, and so
on. What was the fighting about? --- We didn't know. We just heard. It
was something we heard, not knowing what was starting all that. I would
accommodate these children and sleep in my house. And the mosquitoes in
my house - or the area was infested with mosquitoes, which were
troublesome to these children, and my son wasn't there, he was in town
where he was selling. In the afternoon the following day

	/I heard

I heard that in Haladu the situation is not stable, and the message got
to Mhlongo's house claiming that the situation is not stable at all at
Haladu, and we therefore decided to go back to Haladu to see what was
happening. And my son wasn't there at the time, he was with the mother of
the two children. When we got there we did not find the people we wanted
to see, and we found an old lady who told us that yes, it was bad, the
situation was getting volatile. And we heard from this man, who was
telling us that, "Mbuthu's boy was killed. We don't know whether this
Mbuthu boy is the one who was working in town." And I could feel that I
am losing strength as I suspected that that was my son. We did not know
exactly as to who was killed, because he used to travel in a 5 o'clock
bus coming back home, and it had become a custom that we expect him
around five. And when five lapsed my daughter-in-law went to find out if
he was coming or getting off the bus, but to no avail. And I got worried,
continuously so, especially that I had heard already that Mbuthu's son
had died in Haladu. I therefore decided to go to Mhlangeni, where I could
receive my pension fund. I saw cars coming from Nquthu, going by Kelumusa
School, and I was watching then. And those cars just passed right there,
and they were so many, but still I hadn't heard the truth as to who
exactly died because both of my sons were not home. I left there, I went
to Mhlangeni. I saw Haladu residents there and I asked about this Mbuthu
son who's been killed, and no one could open up and forthcoming to me. I
asked Pastor Mchunu, and Pastor Mchunu said, "We've seen that Mbuthu boy
lying down, and when I suggested that we have a look at him they

	/therefore

therefore decided that we shouldn't." As I was there, waiting in the
queue for my pension fund, I conversed with somebody and said, "Mbuthu's
son has died in Haladu," and they responded and said could he be my son.
I was lost. I told them I did not know exactly what happened. "They said
he was taken by the police vehicle to Mondlo. Quickly get done with this
pension money and rush to the police station to have a view on the
corpse." And I went home. When I got home there were tears, people were
mourning.

(Inaudible) ... it's okay. (Pause) --- When I got home I found the
children crying, saying he had been brought by the police. The police
came and he was taken to Nquthu Mortuary. He had died.

(Inaudible) ... continue. (Pause) --- Only to find that the mother with
whom - the mother of the two children got the message as well and went
home, and when she got home - they were together at the time of the
incident. And we decided we should go Nkatheni and run away, leave the
area. Now, the children were attending at Nkatheni, living at Nkatheni
and attending Kelumusa School. Now, my daughter-in-law was the one
relating the whole story as she had witnessed it. We heard from her and
she told us she was expecting him at three. He had left to go to school
to leave a message there, and he never got to school, and he was killed
right there before he could reach the school. And in the morning I saw
the cars there exactly where the incident took place, and my
daughter-in-law had arrived, explaining as to what had happened. It
looked like as he left the house the people were following him with a
gun. Just when he left home one

	/has a

has a whistle, and blowing it, following him. Now, Mrs Khumalo, the
younger wife, the second wife, was relating that. All what this will mean
is that my son died. And we made arrangements for the funeral. We never
buried him in Haladu, but we buried him where we were at the time. After
that, when we tried to go back to find out as to what would happen to his
possessions and stuff, we found out that everything was taken and the
house was destroyed, the doors inside completely destroyed. The house was
not in a good condition. We took whatever we could and left, and we
therefore decided maybe we should go and get the bricks so we could build
a shack. When we went to fetch the bricks that were remaining we first
consulted with the police at Sipiko(?). They took us there and told us
that they were rushing somewhere. After we had loaded the bricks in the
tractor we saw the boys coming, approaching, using the other route, and
other routes were closed. Right next to the wall, standing there, we saw
the group of youths coming, approaching us, and we wondered as to what we
should do at that point in time. I got off the tractor. I tried to go
back to the tractor. I couldn't. I did not know what to do. People were
surprised what I was up to. When I saw them coming close, nearby, I ran
along the houses, going to the other side of the wall, and there was one
girl I was with and my daughter-in-law. My daughter tried to go with my
daughter-in-law and I said, "No, don't do that. Just follow me. Let's
take the opposite direction." As you may be aware I was sick at that
time, so you can imagine what I was facing and what I was in. These
others were left in the tractor and tried to take off. Those who were

	/coming

coming close by tried to approach them on the other side of the road. The
tractor took off and they followed the tractor, hoping that the tractor
will take a U-turn somewhere, but to no avail. The tractor went off. As I
was trying to crawl there in the scene of this incident I managed to get
to a certain spot, where I realised that there were bricks that were left
there, and I was surprised how come because the bricks were supposed to
be in the tractor. When these other two from the tractor got off and
tried to run, and coming back, I heard my daughter shouting and
screaming, crying about the fact that she was going to lose her children.
Well, I enjoyed by stay in Haladu, in a nutshell. I saw the tractor far
away, and suddenly I saw the tractor right next to me, and they said,
"Are you the one?" I said, "Yes, I am the one," and we went on ahead.
What can we therefore do, because there was a horse? They arrived, and
then the bricks were taken one day. But this is such a pathetic story,
the death of my son. You know, we have parents in church. We have parents
in church. Last year in church we had some other parents and the other
relatives as well. When they got home and found out that they were all
there they said to themselves, "Give us money, let's just go back. We
won't go to church with Khanyi. We can't stomach and stand Khanyi."

Did you ever recover all the things from the house, the one where you
went to get bricks from? --- We never went back because they ran after
us. The house was set alight by the way, and many houses were set alight
- my house, the neighbours, and so forth.

(Inaudible) --- I am at Nxakeni.

	/That's

That's the end of the questions. Sorry, just one aspect, auntie. Our
investigators did go to Mondlo Police Station and they did find some
reference to your son's case. The references confirm that there was
political violence in the area between ANC and IFP. Now, your family were
predominantly IFP, is that right? --- That is correct.

And as far as you know the people that killed your son were ANC people?
--- Yes.

Now, your second daughter-in-law, Mrs Khumalo you've called her, what is
her first name please? --- I know Ngehlana. She is Ngehlana Khumalo.

(Inaudible) ... at the moment? --- (Inaudible) CHAIRPERSON: Mrs Dinah, as
we have been listening to your story we just lost - I lost strength, and
as I look right deep into the matter I realise that you are now a
pensioner and you were looking up to your children to provide you with
food and support you, but the direct opposite is true. You've suffered
this ordeal. As we look into our children's future we always think and
hope that they will bury us one day, take care of us as we are growing
old. But I do trust that as I talk to you, and addressing these people in
the hall, everybody has listened to what has been said before the
Commission, and I believe that even if there are some here who are still
intending to do harm, after this they will repent, especially having
listened to people like you. The situation should really change, and
people should see that what happened in the past don't happen in the
future. We will carry on and go on with our investigations, and see how
we could enlist help to you and your daughter-in-law.

	/Thank you

Thank you for taking your time to come here.

I would ask you to be patient. We've come to the end of our programme.
The lady here was the last one, and I believe that we are all touched
after this testimony that has been rendered by the old lady, old as she
is, due to the fact that we were fighting each other as a black community.

	/ON RESUMPTION:

ON RESUMPTION:

CHAIRPERSON: (Incomplete) ... recognise a stranger and a friend amongst
us, Mr Edward Verster. Could you stand up so that we can recognise you.
Thank you. Mr Verster is an attorney from the United States of America.
It is very encouraging to us to see that the international community is
taking an interest in what we as South Africans are trying to achieve
through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. You have already said
that some of your own colleagues have been to listen to what - the
stories that are being related by the people who have undergone different
kinds of suffering during the dark ages of apartheid. So we hope you will
take our greetings back with you, and ... (incomplete - end of Side A,
Tape 8) ... I have your document with me. After we have closed then I'll
be able to hand it over to you.

We have come to the end of the programme of the two days in Vryheid. The
only thing that's left is to thank you and put forward as gratitude as
the Truth Commission. First of all we would like to thank those who made
it possible for the venue. It's not easy to get a venue here in Vryheid,
but still we managed to get this venue to accommodate all of us. And I
would still like to thank the community who took their time to come to
the Commission and listen to each and everything that was said by the
victims and their families, and the witnesses. And also thank you for
your patience. We thank you, the community of Vryheid.

We will put it to you as a community that on the 12th we will be in
Mondlo taking statements at 10.00 am, and on the 13th we will be in
Vryheid taking statements at 	/the same

the same time, 10.00 am. We hope that you will pass the word on.

And also thank the counsellors who were present here and rendering their
services to the victims. We do trust and hope that even after we have
left Vryheid they will still be there and availing their services to
these different victims and families. And also thank the interpreters. If
they were not here this wouldn't be possible. However they manage to
translate and interpret. And also thank those who have provided the
equipment. I have such - I am not so audible when I speak, but I was able
to be audible as a result of this equipment. And also thank the police.
We are in the time when we are not so sure about our safety. The police
have taken their time and made it a point that they are here for our
safety. We would like to thank them in a special way. And also thank the
catering services. We enjoyed the meals, no doubt about that. And I would
like to apologise because I know that not all of you ate, but you know
that's what goes on in the world. Some do get food, some don't, but you
know the situation however. And also thank the staff of the TRC, the
statement-takers. The statements are very important. And also thank every
single person who's a staff personnel at the TRC office, left Durban to
make sure that this is a success and that you are comfortable as you seem
to be. Thank also my colleagues right in front. You have seen how much
effort they've put in, the three of us here. Maybe the two of them they
tried to push everything, and I do believe that you will support me in
saying that everything went on smooth.

When people come to ventilate here some are healed

	/from

from that process - you know, coming out and ventilating the truth,
because to bottle things inside you kills, but for the fact that the
witnesses, the victims came forward to ventilate and take out what was
eating them inside, that process itself alone is healing. And also I want
to highlight the fact that we will never have a prosperous future if we
are not united. Let us assure ourselves of a better future by way of
working hand in hand together.

My colleague here is just mentioning that I have forgotten the media
people. No, I did not forget them. I was about to address them. We would
like to address them. We would like to thank them, and also the media
people. I talked to them this morning that we did not see anything on the
television, national television yesterday. Even during the news nothing
was shown, but today we hope that we will have an opportunity and we will
see the proceedings of the day.

I may be forgetting or omitting a few other things, but my colleagues
will remind me, and I think we are all satisfied that we've heard and I
have thanked everybody. There is a gentleman by the name of Mr Xulu that
I will ask to come forward and close this programme in prayer. Oh, he is
Pastor Xulu, not Mr Xulu. May you request Pastor Xulu. We will kindly ask
the pastor to come forward.

HEARING CLOSES WITH A SONG AND A PRAYER
