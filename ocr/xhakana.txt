NOFUDUKA ELEANOR MAMJOLI XHAKANA: (sworn states)

MS CRICHTON: Mrs Xhakana, you are here to tell us about your husband.
What was his name?

MS XHAKANA: He was Shomboto Rubin Xhakana.

MS CRICHTON: And he was detained for three years. Is that correct?

MS XHAKANA: Yes that is correct.

MS CRICHTON: What was the charge?

MS XHAKANA: He was arrested in the Nonqulana incident.

MS CRICHTON: And on his release he was a very sick man. Did they tell you
in the hospital in Nzimkulu what was wrong with him?

MS XHAKANA: They said that he had been beaten up, he was coughing blood
and he could not hear.

MS CRICHTON: It seems that there were many people who came out of prison,
out of detention who were coughing blood. Why do you think that was?

MS XHAKANA: This was because they were beaten up and they were kicked and
he was beaten up by the back of the rifles.

MS CRICHTON: You also speak how this has affected you. You say that you
have suffered from depression? Are you under any treatment for that?

MS XHAKANA: No. I am under no treatment, because I ... the one of the
state of my health.



MS CRICHTON: I need to ask Mr Lungu the same question. Mrs Xhakana is
there anything else you wish to say?

MS XHAKANA: No thank you.

MS CRICHTON: Thank you very much.

	Thank you Mr Chairman.
