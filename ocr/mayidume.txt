NELSIE MAYIDUME: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: Mrs Mayidume you have the evidence that have been put before
us. I want to know if you are confirming this evidence. If you are, is
there something you would like to add?

MRS MAYIDUME: Thank you Mr Chairperson.

	 There is nothing I would like to add because my requests are
documented. I just pray that the Lord may fulfil my needs.

	I also request that something may be done to commemorate Nonqulana so
that the future generations may see where the battle started and men died
for our land.

	Thank you Sir.
