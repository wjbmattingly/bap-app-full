DALIWE MGULWA: (sworn states)

ADV SANDI: Mr Mgulwa you are also going to talk about the execution of a
member of your family. Who are you going to talk about exactly?

MR MGULWA: My father.

ADV SANDI: Can you briefly tell us when he was executed and what the
cause was.

MR MGULWA: They were arrested after Khongolose. They were then detained
in Kokstad. Then taken to Pietermaritzburg. From there apparently they
were taken to Pretoria. After that we could not get into touch with them.

	When my father was arrested I was 17 years of age.

ADV SANDI: Is there someone at home who would visit him?

MR MGULWA: My mother was still alive. She would visit him. My grandfather
as well. They have both passed away.

They were there even in Pretoria.

ADV SANDI: According to your memory you say that your father was executed
in 1962.

MR MGULWA: He was detained in 1960. Then in 1961 he was in jail. Then in
1962 he was executed.

ADV SANDI: Was he a member of Congo?

MR MGULWA: Yes.

ADV SANDI: Was he affected when there was conflict between members of
Congo and chiefs in the area?

MR MGULWA: Yes because the Chief wanted to do whatever he pleased with
the people. He did not agree with that. Then there were killings.

ADV SANDI: 	Who said, he is ruling over these people?

MR MGULWA: The Chief. He did not want Congo to exist in the area. He did
not want the struggle for liberation. He brought them down, all the
leaders of Congo. About one hundred of them were detained. Ninety four
came back and six never came back.

	The ninety four people were freed.

ADV SANDI: When you gave the statement to the statement takers of the
Truth Commission you put forward requests. Do you remember these requests?

MR MGULWA: Yes. So that I could have peace in my heart, if my father
could be exhumed and be buried back home. Also the children, three are
still at school. If the Government could help me.

ADV SANDI: You also said that amongst your requests the Commission should
perhaps do something about the water supplies in the area and also if
something could be done about the roads.

	Would you like to add something to that request?

MR MGULWA: No. My requests are such as you have mentioned.

ADV SANDI: Is there a problem in the community with water supply? Clean
water supply and also roads that are conducive to travelling? Is that a
general problem in your village?

MR MGULWA: Yes.

ADV SANDI: Is that all Sir?

MR MGULWA: Yes I have finished.

ADV SANDI: Thank you.
