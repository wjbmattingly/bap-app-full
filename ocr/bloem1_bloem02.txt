We went out of that house and then we found people already gathered and they were surrounding a car near that house. Then I paved my way to go right in the circle next to the car, then it was a Pulsar make, inside were two people at the back and then in front was a man and a woman and I asked them what do you want in the location?   Then the people who were at the back told me that they were looking shebeens and they were looking for women.

I was on the scene at that time.MR MPSHE:   Let me put it this way.  Why did you give an instruction or an order that they be killed?MR HLOBO:   I was able to detect that the situation in which BLOEMFONTEIN HEARING	AMNESTY/FREE STATEMR MPSHE	41	MR HLOBOwe were in at that time was tense, the situation was tense, because in Kothlanong township in Odendaalsrus Inkatha Freedom Party was coming to attack the comrades, then I took it that these people are coming to attack the comrades, because they came to Mashengoville and they are coming to attack therefore I decided that we should attack them first before they attacked us because they came at night, they came around eight o'clock at night.MR MPSHE:   Now when did you know that your area was going to be attacked?MR HLOBO:   It was on a Monday because some of them - there were men, three men who came to me who were members of the Russian gang that on Sunday was a meeting at Mr Sithole's house together with the Russians and the Inkatha members and they told me on Monday around three o'clock.MR MPSHE:   Now let us go to - let us concentrate on the time before the incident, before the killings, before the killings did you have any information that the area was going to be attacked?MR HLOBO:   Yes I did have information that our area is going to be attacked.MR MPSHE:   And how did you know, how did you receive that information?

When we arrived outside I asked him as whether he has a whistle then he said yes he had it, and then he pulled it BLOEMFONTEIN HEARING	AMNESTY/FREE STATEMR MPSHE	42	MR HLOBOout, I took his whistle then I blew it, because we were the comrades.  The way we were calling each was using the whistles, and those who were near came and we gathered.  Then we discussed among ourselves that we should go to the squatter camp.  Inside the squatter camps we saw people gathered around armed with dangerous weapons and the police were there.  That's where we took a decision then.MR MPSHE:   Yes Mr Chairman.
