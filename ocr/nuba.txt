DATE: 25.03.1997		NAME: JONGINDLU THEOPHILUS NUBA

DAY: 2				LUSIKISIKI

JONGINDLU THEOPHILUS NUBA: (sworn states)

CHAIRPERSON: Sir you have heard the evidence. Do you confirm this
evidence or maybe you want to add.

MR NUBA: I confirm the evidence but I would like to emphasise the request
concerning Nonqulana. I felt bad when Ndlovu and Ngquza mountains were
put before Nonqulana, because everything started at Nonqulana when the
comrades were standing up against the tyrannical reign of the Government
of the day. The heroes of Pondoland went to meet at Nonqulana, standing
up against an autocratic rule.

	The root was Ngquza. This is why I wanted to emphasise that history
begins at Nonqulana. This is how it can be complete.

	Thank you.

CHAIRPERSON: Where is Segilwe?

MR NUBA: It is in Bizana.

	Thank you Sir.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you for having helped to get a fuller picture of what
happened.

	Mr Sandi is going to thank you on behalf of the Commission.

MR NUBA: Pardon me. I request that there be RDP services at Nonqulana.

MR SANDI: Even though you did not warn me that I am going to be thanking
these people, therefore what I will

be saying will be truly from my heart, because I did not prepare anything.

	We thank all the witnesses that came before us as we have been
endeavouring to look at the matter, the Ngquza incident. The witnesses
that came before us from yesterday to today, our efforts perhaps are
something that is life to you but to us it is a part of history.

	In our historical documentation this incident is only reported, but now
that we are here we realise how much it contributed to the political
struggle.

	I thank you on behalf of the Commission.

CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. You may step down.
