ON RESUMPTION:  2ND SEPTEMBER 1999 - DAY 3
MATTER: POSTPONEMENT - APPLICATION OF MR NTOKA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------CHAIRPERSON:   This morning we continue with the matter of the application of Mr Ntoka.  By agreement and by arrangement with the various representatives and the Committee we have decided that for technical reasons this matter cannot be proceeded with and will be removed from this week's roll and to be possibly re-enrolld only after the investigations that are necessary in this matter have been completed.  It is unfortunate that we cannot continue with this matter today, but they are for reasons beyond anybody's control.  I am satisfied that the removal is proper.
	That brings us to the end of this week's roll, and I thank the technical staff, including the interpreters for their assistance.  They're normally in the background and are taken for granted.  I thank the public for taking interest in this matter and all the other matters that they've come to here, and I thank the various representatives for the assistance that they have given.
	We're adjourned.
